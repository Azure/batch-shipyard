# HPCG-Infiniband-IntelMPI
This recipe shows how to run the High Performance Conjugate Gradients
[HPCG](http://www.hpcg-benchmark.org/index.html) benchmark
on Linux using Intel MPI over Infiniband/RDMA Azure VM instances in an Azure
Batch compute pool. Execution of this distributed workload requires the use of
[multi-instance tasks](../../docs/80-batch-shipyard-multi-instance-tasks.md).

Execution under both Docker and Singularity are shown in this recipe.

Note that this container can only be executed on Intel processors.

## Configuration
Please see refer to the [set of sample configuration files](./config) for
this recipe. The directory `docker` will contain the Docker-based execution
while the `singularity` directory will contain the Singularity-based
execution configuration.

### Pool Configuration
The pool configuration should enable the following properties:
* `vm_size` should be a CPU-only
[RDMA-enabled instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc).
* `vm_configuration` is the VM configuration. Please select an appropriate
`platform_image` with IB/RDMA as
[supported by Batch Shipyard](../../docs/25-batch-shipyard-platform-image-support.md).
* `inter_node_communication_enabled` must be set to `true`

### Global Configuration
#### Docker-based
The global configuration should set the following properties:
* `docker_images` array must have a reference to a valid HPCG image
that can be run with Intel MPI and Infiniband in a Docker container context
on Azure VM instances. This can be `alfpark/linpack:2018-intel-mkl` which is
published on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alfpark/linpack). HPCG is
included in the Linpack image.

#### Singularity-based
The global configuration should set the following properties:
* `singularity_images` array must have a reference to a valid HPCG image
that can be run with Intel MPI and Infiniband. This can be
`image: library://alfpark/linpack/linpack:2018-intel-mkl` which is
published on the [Singularity Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/alfpark/linpack/linpack).
Since this image is signed, it should be placed under the `signed` section
with the appropriate `signing_key`. Please see the `config.yaml` file for
more information.

### Jobs Configuration
#### Docker-based
The jobs configuration should set the following properties within the `tasks`
array which should have a task definition containing:
* `docker_image` should be the name of the Docker image for this container
invocation. For this example, this can be `alfpark/linpack:2018-intel-mkl`.
* `command` is the command that should be invoked by `mpirun`. For this recipe,
the `command` should be:
`/bin/bash -c "cd /opt/intel2/mkl/benchmarks/hpcg/bin && export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$(nproc) && ./$EXE --n=$N --t=$T"`
* `infiniband` can be set to `true`, however, it is implicitly enabled by
Batch Shipyard when executing on a RDMA-enabled compute pool.
* `environment_variables` should have the following settings
  * `EXE` should be set to the appropriate program executable according to
    the AVX VM CPU capability. Use `xhpcg_avx` for A8/A9, use `xhpcg_avx2`
    for H-series, or use `xhpcg_skx` for Hc-series.
* `multi_instance` property must be defined
  * `num_instances` should be set to `pool_specification_vm_count_dedicated`,
    `pool_vm_count_low_priority`, `pool_current_dedicated`, or
    `pool_current_low_priority`
  * `coordination_command` should be unset or `null`. For pools with
    `native` container support, this command should be supplied if
    a non-standard `sshd` is required.
  * `mpi` property must be defined
    * `runtime` should be either `intelmpi-ofa` or `intelmpi` depending upon
      the Intel MPI version used.
    * `processes_per_node` should be set to `1`

#### Singularity-based
The jobs configuration should set nearly the same properties as the
Docker-based execution except for the following:
* `singularity_image` should be the name of the Singularity image for this
container invocation. For this example, this should be
`library://alfpark/linpack/linpack:2018-intel-mkl`.
