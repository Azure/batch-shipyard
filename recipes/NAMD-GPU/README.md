# NAMD-GPU
This recipe shows how to run [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/)
2.11 on Linux using the
[Charm++ runtime](http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/manuals/html/charm++/)
for single-node GPU execution which can span multiple GPUs if available.

## Configuration
Please see refer to this [set of sample configuration files](./config) for
this recipe.

### Pool Configuration
The pool configuration should enable the following properties:
* `vm_size` must be one of `STANDARD_NC6`, `STANDARD_NC12`, `STANDARD_NC24`,
`STANDARD_NV6`, `STANDARD_NV12`, `STANDARD_NV24`. `NC` VM instances feature
K80 GPUs for GPU compute acceleration while `NV` VM instances feature
M60 GPUs for visualization workloads. Because NAMD is a GPU-accelerated
compute application, it is best to choose `NC` VM instances.
* `vm_configuration` is the VM configuration
  * `platform_image` specifies to use a platform image
    * `publisher` should be `Canonical` or `OpenLogic`.
    * `offer` should be `UbuntuServer` for Canonical or `CentOS` for OpenLogic.
    * `sku` should be `16.04-LTS` for Ubuntu or `7.3` for CentOS.

### Global Configuration
The global configuration should set the following properties:
* `docker_images` array must have a reference to the NAMD-GPU image. This
can be `alfpark/namd:2.11-cuda` which is published on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alfpark/namd/).

### Jobs Configuration
The jobs configuration should set the following properties within the `tasks`
array which should have a task definition containing:
* `image` should be the name of the Docker image for this container invocation,
e.g., `alfpark/namd:2.11-cuda`
* `command` should contain the `mpirun` command. If using the sample NAMD-GPU
image provided, `"/sw/run_namd.sh <benchmark> <steps> <ppn>"` can be used
to run the included benchmarks:
  * `<benchmark>` is the benchmark to run: `apoa1` or `stmv`
  * `<steps>` is the number of steps to execute
  * `<ppn>` is the number of cores on each compute node. This is optional
    and, if omitted, will be determined dynamically.
* `gpu` must be set to `true`. This enables invoking the `nvidia-docker`
wrapper.

## Dockerfile and supplementary files
The `Dockerfile` for the Docker image can be found [here](./docker). Please
note that you must agree with the
[NAMD license](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/license.html) before
using this Docker image.
