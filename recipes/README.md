# Batch Shipyard Recipes
Batch Shipyard can accommodate most containerized Batch and HPC workloads.
This area contains recipes and sample container workloads that may
relate to your own anticipated scenario. Batch Shipyard is not limited to
these programs or types of workloads represented by these recipes, but can
run arbitrary containers to execute your Batch and HPC scenario.

Please note that all recipes have sample configurations that you can use to
quickly get started, however, some of the config files cannot be used as-is
as they may need to be modified for specific values (such as the
`credentials.yaml` file which needs to be populated with your Batch and
Storage account credentials). Please review each config file you are planning
on using and modify accordingly. As these recipe configuration are intended
to show example usage, you will need to modify and configure them for your
actual workloads.

If you would like to contribute your recipe, please take a look at
[this guide](../docs/98-contributing-recipes.md) before submitting a
pull request.
