# Batch Shipyard Recipes
This directory contains recipes and sample batch-style Docker workloads for
use with Batch Shipyard on Azure Batch. Please note that all recipes have
sample configurations that you can use to quickly get going, however, some
of the config files cannot be used as-is as they may need to be modified for
specific values (such as the `credentials.json` file which needs to be
populated with your Batch and Storage account credentials). Please review each
config file you are planning on using and modify accordingly. As the config
samples are bare examples only, you will need to configure them to your liking
for actual workloads.

If you would like to contribute your recipe, please take a look at
[this guide](../docs/98-contributing-recipes.md) before submitting a
pull request.
