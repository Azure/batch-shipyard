# Batch Shipyard
[Batch Shipyard](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard) is a tool to help
provision and execute container-based batch processing and HPC workloads on
[Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/batch/) compute
pools. Batch Shipyard supports both [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/) containers! No experience with the
[Azure Batch SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-batch-samples) is needed; run
your containers with easy-to-understand configuration files.

Additionally, Batch Shipyard provides the ability to provision and manage
entire [standalone remote file systems (storage clusters)](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/65-batch-shipyard-remote-fs/)
in Azure, independent of any integrated Azure Batch functionality.

Batch Shipyard is now integrated directly into
[Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview)
and you can execute any Batch Shipyard workload using your web browser or the Microsoft Azure [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.azure&hl=en)
and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-azure/id1219013620?mt=8)
app. 

Try Batch Shipyard now from your browser:

## Major Features
* Automated [Docker Host Engine](https://www.docker.com) and
[Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/) installations tuned for
Azure Batch compute nodes
* Automated deployment of required Docker and/or Singularity images to
compute nodes
* Accelerated Docker and Singularity image deployment at scale to compute
pools consisting of a large number of VMs via private peer-to-peer
distribution of container images among the compute nodes
* Mixed mode support for Docker and Singularity: run your Docker and
Singularity containers within the same job, side-by-side or even concurrently
* Comprehensive data movement support: move data easily between locally
accessible storage systems, remote filesystems, Azure Blob or File Storage,
and compute nodes
* Support for Docker Registries including
[Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)
and other Internet-accessible public and private registries
* Support for the [Singularity Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/) Container
Registry
* [Standalone Remote Filesystem Provisioning](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/65-batch-shipyard-remote-fs/)
with integration to auto-link these filesystems to compute nodes with support for
    * [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System)
    * [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) distributed network file system
* Automatic shared data volume support
    * Remote Filesystems as provisioned by Batch Shipyard
    * [Azure File](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/) via SMB
    * [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) provisioned directly on compute nodes
* Seamless integration with Azure Batch job, task and file concepts along with
full pass-through of the
[Azure Batch API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-api-basics/)
to containers executed on compute nodes
* Support for [Low Priority Compute Nodes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-low-pri-vms)
* Support for [pool autoscale](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/30-batch-shipyard-autoscale/) and autopool
to dynamically scale and control computing resources on-demand
* Support for [Task Factories](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/35-batch-shipyard-task-factory/)
with the ability to generate tasks based on parametric (parameter) sweeps,
randomized input, file enumeration, replication, and custom Python code-based
generators
* Support for deploying Batch compute nodes into a specified
[Virtual Network](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/64-batch-shipyard-byovnet/)
* Transparent support for GPU-accelerated container applications on both
[Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) and Singularity
on [Azure N-Series VM instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu)
* Support for multi-instance tasks to accommodate MPI and multi-node cluster
applications packaged in Docker or Singularity on compute pools with
automatic job completion and task termination
* Transparent assist for running Docker and Singularity containers utilizing
Infiniband/RDMA for MPI on HPC low-latency Azure VM instances:
    * [A-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc): STANDARD\_A8, STANDARD\_A9
    * [H-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc): STANDARD\_H16R, STANDARD\_H16MR
    * [N-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu): STANDARD\_NC24R
* Support for [Azure Batch task dependencies](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/batch-task-dependencies/)
allowing complex processing pipelines and DAGs with containers
* Support for job schedules and recurrences for automatic execution of
tasks at set intervals
* Support for live job and job schedule migration between pools
* Automatic setup of SSH users to all nodes in the compute pool and optional
tunneling to Docker Hosts on compute nodes
* Support for credential management through
[Azure KeyVault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/)
* Support for execution on an
[Azure Function App environment](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/60-batch-shipyard-site-extension/)
* Support for [custom host images](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/63-batch-shipyard-custom-images/)
* Support for [Windows Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/)
on compliant Windows compute node pools
