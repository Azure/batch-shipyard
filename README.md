# Batch Shipyard
<img src="https://azurebatchshipyard.blob.core.windows.net/github/README-dash.png" alt="dashboard" width="1024" />

[Batch Shipyard](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard) is a tool to help
provision, execute, and monitor container-based batch processing and HPC
workloads on
[Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/batch/). Batch Shipyard
supports both [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io) containers! No experience with the
[Azure Batch SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-batch-samples) is needed; run
your containers with easy-to-understand configuration files. All Azure
regions are supported, including non-public Azure regions.

Additionally, Batch Shipyard provides the ability to provision and manage
entire [standalone remote file systems (storage clusters)](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/65-batch-shipyard-remote-fs/)
in Azure, independent of any integrated Azure Batch functionality.

## Major Features
* Automated [Docker Host Engine](https://www.docker.com) and
[Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io) installations tuned for
Azure Batch compute nodes
* Automated deployment of required Docker and/or Singularity images to
compute nodes
* Mixed mode support for Docker and Singularity: run your Docker and
Singularity containers within the same job, side-by-side or even concurrently
* Comprehensive [data movement](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/70-batch-shipyard-data-movement/)
support: move data easily between locally accessible storage systems, remote
filesystems, Azure Blob or File Storage, and compute nodes
* Support for
[serverless execution](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/60-batch-shipyard-site-extension/)
binding with Azure Functions
* [Federation](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/68-batch-shipyard-federation/)
support: enables unified, constraint-based scheduling to collections of
heterogeneous pools, including across multiple Batch accounts and Azure
regions
* Automated, integrated
[resource monitoring](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/66-batch-shipyard-resource-monitoring/)
with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
for Batch pools and RemoteFS storage clusters
* [Standalone Remote Filesystem Provisioning](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/65-batch-shipyard-remote-fs/)
with integration to auto-link these filesystems to compute nodes with
support for [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) and
[GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) distributed network file system
* Automatic shared data volume support for linking to Remote Filesystems as
provisioned by Batch Shipyard, [Azure File](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/)
via SMB, [Azure Blob](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/)
via [blobfuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse),
[GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) provisioned directly on compute nodes
(which can act as a distributed local file system/cache), and custom Linux
mount support (fstab)
* Support for simple, scenario-based [pool autoscale](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/30-batch-shipyard-autoscale/)
and autopool to dynamically scale and control computing resources on-demand
* Support for [Task Factories](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/35-batch-shipyard-task-factory-merge-task/)
with the ability to generate tasks based on parametric (parameter) sweeps,
randomized input, file enumeration, replication, and custom Python code-based
generators
* Transparent support for GPU-accelerated container applications on both
[Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) and Singularity
on [Azure N-Series VM instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu)
* Support for multi-instance tasks to accommodate MPI and multi-node cluster
applications packaged as Docker or Singularity containers on compute pools
with automatic job completion and task termination
* Transparent assist for running Docker and Singularity containers utilizing
Infiniband/RDMA for MPI on HPC low-latency Azure VM instances including
[A-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc),
[H-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc),
and [N-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu)
* Seamless integration with Azure Batch job, task and file concepts along with
full pass-through of the
[Azure Batch API](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-api-basics/)
to containers executed on compute nodes
* Support for [Azure Batch task dependencies](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-task-dependencies/)
allowing complex processing pipelines and DAGs
* Support for merge or final task specification that automatically depends
on all other tasks within the job
* Support for job schedules and recurrences for automatic execution of
tasks at set intervals
* Support for live job and job schedule migration between pools
* Support for credential management through
[Azure KeyVault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/)
* Support for Docker Registries including
[Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/),
other Internet-accessible public and private registries, and support for
the [Singularity Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/) Container Registry
* Support for [Low Priority Compute Nodes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-low-pri-vms)
* Support for deploying Batch compute nodes into a specified
[Virtual Network](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/64-batch-shipyard-byovnet/)
* Automatic setup of SSH or RDP users to all nodes in the compute pool and
optional creation of SSH tunneling scripts to Docker Hosts on compute nodes
* Support for [custom host images](http://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/63-batch-shipyard-custom-images/)
* Support for [Windows Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/)
on compliant Windows compute node pools with the ability to activate
[Azure Hybrid Use Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/)
if applicable
* Accelerated Docker and Singularity image deployment at scale to compute
pools consisting of a large number of VMs via private peer-to-peer
distribution of container images among the compute nodes
