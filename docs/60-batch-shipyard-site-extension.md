# Batch Shipyard Site Extension for use with Azure Functions/App Service
The focus of this article is to describe the process for enabling the Batch
Shipyard site extension in Azure App Service (e.g., Azure Function App) to
be used for processing as a result of a trigger.

## Setup and Installation
The following assumes that you are able to interact with the
[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) for creating and setting up your
Azure Function App with the Batch Shipyard site extension.

### Step 1: Create an Azure Function App
The first step is to create an Azure Function App. The leftmost navigation
bar, you will see a plus sign. Select `Compute >` and then
`Function App`.

In the create blade, fill in the appropriate properties for your Function App.
Ensure that your Hosting Plan is set to `App Service Plan` and use the
`App Service plan/Location` to create a new App Service plan (if applicable).
Very basic plans may lead to startup delay in Batch Shipyard.

### Step 2: Install Python 3.X x64 Site Extension
Now we'll install Python 3.x as a site extension as a pre-requisite for
Batch Shipyard. To do this, navigate to your newly created Function App.
Select your function app and then select `Platform features` on the right.

In the next blade, select `Advanced tools (Kudu)`.

Click on `Extensions` on the top navigation bar and then click on
`Gallery` below. This will load all of the available site extensions
defaulted to [siteextensions.net](https://siteextensions.net/) which is the
official nuget feed for Azure App Site Extensions.

You should select the latest version of Python 3.X x64 that is available.
At the time of this writing, Python 3.6.1 x64 was the latest available. Click
the `+` icon to install this site extension to your Azure Function App
environment.

### Step 3: Install Batch Shipyard Site Extension
After Python 3.X x64 installs successfully, find the `Batch Shipyard`
site extension in the same `Gallery` area. Click the `+` icon to install the
Batch Shipyard site extension to your Azure Function app environment.

Please be patient during this step, as installation may take a while depending
upon the App Service plan you have selected. Once the Batch Shipyard site
extension installation completes, hit the `Restart Site` button at the top
right.

You are now ready to run Batch Shipyard in your Azure Function App
environment.

## Invoking Batch Shipyard in an Azure Function App
The Batch Shipyard site extension automatically attempts to find the version
of Python installed via the site extension and links the version found with
the Batch Shipyard invocation. As part of the site extension, a global
application environment variable is defined, `BATCH_SHIPYARD_CMD`, which
can be used in your `run.py` (or other function language trigger script).
If this environment variable is not available, then you may have skipped
the `Restart Site` step in Step 3 above.

For example, a python `run.py` trigger script to invoke would look
something like:

```python
import os
import subprocess

cmd = os.environ['BATCH_SHIPYARD_CMD']
stdout = subprocess.check_output(cmd)
print(stdout)
```

This, of course, does nothing but invoking `shipyard` via the
`BATCH_SHIPYARD_CMD` environment variable without any commands and parameters.
The `stdout` variable would contain only the help text.

You can also define Azure App Settings that populate environment variables
such as `SHIPYARD_CONFIGDIR`, `SHIPYARD_AAD_DIRECTORY_ID`, etc. such that
these variables are automatically populated for you when your trigger
executes.
