# Troubleshooting Guide
This guide is to help in the event you encounter issues while using Batch
Shipyard. You can also visit the [FAQ](97-faq.md) for other questions
that do not fall in to the categories below.

## <a name="install"></a>Installation Issues
#### Anaconda Python Environments
[Anaconda](https://continuum.io) Python environments are structured
differently than standard [CPython](https://python.org) environments.
Anaconda has isolated environments which are conceptually equivalent to
[Virtual Environments](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and also
have separate packaging mechanisms than packages traditionally found on
PyPI. As such, special attention should be given when installing Batch
Shipyard into an Anaconda environment. It is highly recommended to use
an Anaconda environment that provides Python 3.5 or higher if using Anaconda.
In general, it is recommended to use [CPython](https://python.org) especially
when installing into virtual environments (the recommended installation
method) as the command lag can be much shorter.

However, if you do plan to use Anaconda, then it is recommended to use the
`install.sh` script to install on an Anaconda environment on Linux and
the `install.cmd` command file to install on an Anaconda environment on
Windows.

## <a name="batchservice"></a>Azure Batch Service Issues
#### Check Azure Batch Service Status
If you suspect possible Azure Batch service issues, you can check the status
of Azure services [at this website](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/).

## <a name="computenode"></a>Compute Pool and Node Issues
#### Resize Error is encounted with pool
Resize errors with a pool can happen any time a pool is growing or shrinking.
Remember that when you issue `pool add`, a pool starts with zero compute nodes
and then grows to the target number of nodes specified. You can query the
pools in your account with the `pool list` command and any resize errors
will be displayed. You can also query this information using Azure Portal
or Batch Labs. If it appears that the resize error was transient,
you can try to issue `pool resize` to begin the pool grow or shrink process
again, or alternatively you can opt to recreate the pool.

There are typically three common reasons for Resize Errors:
1. Insufficient core quota: Non-UserSubscription Batch accounts by default
have 20 cores associated with them. These core quota are managed independently
of any core quota on the associated subscription. UserSubscription Batch
Accounts have core quota that is associated with the subscription. Please
follow [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-quota-limit)
for submitting a support request to increase your core quota.
2. Operation(s) took longer than expected: Resizing the pool to a different
target VM count may take longer than the specified timeout. In these cases,
re-issue the resize command.
3. Not enough IPs in the virtual network subnet: When creating a pool with
a UserSubscription Batch account with a virtual network, you must ensure
that there are sufficient number of VMs in your subnet. Batch Shipyard will
attempt to validate this on your behalf if you specify the subnet's address
range in the configuration. You can attempt to change the address range
of the subnet indpendently (if pre-created) and issue the resize command
again if you encounter this issue.

#### Compute Node start task failure
Batch Shipyard installs the Docker Host Engine and other requisite software
when the compute node starts. There is a possibility for the start task to
fail due to transient network faults when issuing system software updates.
You can turn on automatic rebooting where Batch Shipyard can attempt to
mitigate the issue on your behalf in the `pool.json` config file.
Alternatively, you can issue the command
`pool rebootnode --all-start-task-failed` which will attempt to reboot the
nodes that have entered this state.

If the compute node fails to start properly, Batch Shipyard will automatically
download the compute node's stdout and stderr files for the start task into
the directory where you ran `shipyard`. The files will be placed in
`<pool name>/<node id>/startup/std{err,out}.txt`. You can examine these files
to see what the possible culprit for the issue is. If it appears to be
transient, you can try to create the pool again. If it appears to be a Batch
Shipyard issue, please report the issue on GitHub.

Additionally, if you have specified an SSH user for your pool and there
is a start task failure, you can still issue the command `pool asu` to add the
pool SSH user and then `pool ssh` to SSH into the node to debug further.

#### Compute Node does not start or is unusable
If the compute node is "stuck" in starting state or enters unusable state,
this indicates that there was an issue allocating the node from the Azure
Cloud. Azure Batch automatically tries to recover from such situations, but
may not be able to on occasion. In these circumstances, it is best
to delete the specific node with `pool delnode` and then resize back up with
`pool resize` or recreate the pool.

#### Compute Node is stuck in waiting for start task
Compute nodes that appear to be "stuck" in waiting for start task may not be
stuck at all. If you specify that nodes should block for all Docker images to
be present on the node before allowing scheduling and your Docker images are
large, it may take a while for your compute nodes to transition from waiting
for start task to idle.

If you are certain the above is not the cause for this behavior, then it
may indicate a regression in the Batch Shipyard code, a new Docker release
that is causing interaction issues (e.g., with nvidia-docker) or some other
problem that was not caught during testing. You can retrieve the compute
node start task stdout and stderr files to diagnose further and report an
issue on GitHub if it appears to be a defect.

## <a name="task"></a>Job/Task Execution Issues
#### Task is submitted but doesn't run
There are various reasons why this would happen:

1. There are insufficient compute nodes to service the job
2. The task is multi-instance and there are not enough compute nodes to
run the job as specified
3. `jobs.json` file was submitted with the wrong `pool.json` file causing
a mismatch in the target pool for the jobs
4. `jobs.json` file was submitted with the wrong `config.json` file causing
an infinite wait on a Docker image to be present that may not exist

#### Task runs and completes but fails with a non-zero exit code or scheduling error
In Azure Batch, a task that completes is independent of if the task is
considered a success or failure. The `jobs listtasks` command will list
the status of all tasks for the jobs specified including exit codes and
any scheduling errors. You can use this information in combination with the
task's stdout and stderr files to determine what went wrong if your task
has completed but has failed.

## <a name="docker"></a>Docker Issues
#### `pool udi` command doesn't run
The pool update Docker images command runs as a normal job. Thus, your compute
nodes must be able to accommodate this update job and task. If your pool only
has one node in it, it will run as a single task under a job. If the node in
this pool is busy and the `max_tasks_per_node` in your `pool.json` is either
unspecified or set to 1, then it will be blocked behind the running task.

For pools with more than 1 node, the update Docker images command will run
as a multi-instance task to guarantee that all nodes in the pool have updated
the specified Docker image to latest or the given hash. The multi-instance
task will be run on the current number of nodes in the pool at the time
the `pool udi` command is issued. If before the task can be scheduled, the
pool is resized down and the number of nodes decreases, then the update
Docker images job will not be able to execute and will stay active until
the number of compute nodes reaches the prior number. Additionally, if
`max_tasks_per_node` is set to 1 or unspecified in `pool.json` and any
task is running on any node, the update Docker images job will be blocked
until that task completes.

You can work around this behavior by providing the `--ssh` option to the
`pool udi` command. This will use an SSH side-channel to upgrade the Docker
images on the pool. Please note that this requires a provisioned SSH user
and `ssh` or `ssh.exe` available.

`pool udi` will always use the SSH side-channel method for pools containing
a positive number of low priority nodes.
