# Current Limitations
Please read the following carefully concerning current limitations with
Batch Shipyard and Docker-enabled compute pools. If using low-priority
compute nodes, please also refer to the
[Low Priority Compute Node Considerations](95-low-priority-considerations.md)
document.

### Azure Batch and Batch Shipyard Command Restrictions
The following Azure Batch actions should only be performed through Batch
Shipyard when deploying your workload through this toolkit as Batch
Shipyard needs to take special actions or ensure the intended outcome:
* Task termination (if task is running): use `jobs termtasks`
* Task deletion (if task is running): use `jobs deltasks`
* Job termination (if any tasks are running in the job): use the
  `--termtasks` option with `jobs term`
* Job deletion (if any tasks are running in the job): use the
  `--termtasks` option with `jobs del`
* Pool resize: use `pool resize`
* Pool deletion: use `pool del`

Additionally, you cannot add Batch Shipyard tasks to a non-Batch Shipyard
allocated pool since all of the preparation for each compute node will not
be present in those pools. Please use `pool add` with your pool specification
to create compute resources to execute your Batch Shipyard jobs against.

### General Limitations and Restrictions
* Tasks can have a maximum run time of 7 days (including time spent for
data movement). This is a current fundamental limitation in the Azure Batch
service.
* It is recommended to provision an SSH user to aid in client-side assisted
task termination and other tasks that may require direct SSH access.
* SSH tunnel script generation is only compatible with non-Windows machines.
* Data movement support on Windows is restricted to scp. Both `ssh.exe` and
`scp.exe` must be found through `%PATH%` or in the current working directory.
Rsync is not supported in Windows.
* `pool ssh` support in Windows is only available if `ssh.exe` is found
through `%PATH%` or is in the current working directory.
* Credential encryption support in Windows is available only if `openssl.exe`
is found through `%PATH%` or is in the current working directory.
* Compute pool resize down (i.e., removing nodes from a pool) is not supported
when peer-to-peer transfer is enabled.
* The maximum number of compute nodes with peer-to-peer enabled is currently
40 for Linux pools for non-UserSubscription Batch accounts. This check is
no longer performed before a pool is created and will instead result in
a ResizeError on the pool if not all compute nodes can be allocated.
* Data movement between Batch tasks as defined by `input_data`:`azure_batch`
is restricted to Batch accounts with keys (non-AAD).
* Virtual network support in Batch pools can only be used with
UserSubscription Batch accounts.
* Windows Server 2016, Clear Linux, and Oracle Linux are not supported with
Batch Shipyard at this time.
* Task dependencies are incompatible with multi-instance tasks. This is a
current limitation of the underlying Azure Batch service.
* Only Intel MPI can be used in conjunction Infiniband/RDMA on Azure Linux VMs.
This is a current limitation of the underlying VM and host drivers.
* Adding tasks to the same job across multiple, concurrent Batch Shipyard
invocations may result in failure if task ids for these jobs are
auto-generated.
