# Batch Shipyard Remote Filesystem Configuration
This page contains in-depth details on how to configure the remote filesystem
json file for Batch Shipyard.

## Schema

```

## Details
The remote fs schema is constructed from two portions. The first section
specifies
[Azure Managed Disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview)
to use in the storage cluster. The second section defines the storage cluster
itself, including networking and virtual machine to disk mapping.

There are two properties which reside outside of these sections:
* (optional) `resource_group` this is the default resource group to use
for both the `managed_disks` and `storage_clusters` sections. This setting
is only used if `resource_group` is not explicitly set in their respective
configuration blocks.
* (required) `location` is the Azure region name for the resources, e.g.,
`eastus` or `northeurope`. The `location` specified must match the same
region as your Azure Batch account if linking a compute pool with a storage
cluster.

### Managed Disks: `managed_disks`
This section defines the disks used by the file server as specified in the
`storage_clusters` section. Not all disks specified here need to be used by
the storage cluster, but every disk in the storage cluster should be
defined in this section.
* (optional) `resource_group` this is the resource group to use for the
disks. If this is not specified, then the `resource_group` specified in
the parent is used. At least one `resource_group` must be defined.
* (optional) `premium` defines if
[premium managed disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-premium-storage)
should be created. Premium storage provisions a
[guaranteed level of IOPS and bandwidth](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-premium-storage#premium-storage-scalability-and-performance-targets)
that scales with disk size. The default is `false` which creates
standard managed disks. Regardless of the type of storage used to back
managed disks, all data written is durable and persistent backed to Azure
Storage.
* (required) `disk_size_gb` is an integral value defining the size of the
data disks to create. Note that for managed disks, you are billed rounded
up to the nearest provisioned size. If you are unfamiliar with
how Azure prices managed disks with regard to the size of disk chosen,
please refer to
[this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview#pricing-and-billing).
* (required) `disk_names` is an array of disk names to create. All disks
will be created identically with the properties defined in the `managed_disks`
section.

### Storage Clusters: `storage_clusters`
This section defines the storage clusters containing the file server
specification and disk mapping. This section cross-references the
`managed_disks` section so both sections must be populated when performing
`fs cluster` actions.

You can specify multiple storage clusters in the `storage_clusters` section.
Each key in the `storage_clusters` dictionary is a unique id for the
storage cluster that you intend to create. This storage cluster id should be
used as the `STORAGE_CLUSTER_ID` argument for all `fs cluster`
actions in the CLI along with any configuration specified for linking against
Azure Batch pools, if specified, for `pool add`. `data ingress` will also
take this storage cluster id as a parameter if transfering to the file
system. Each storage cluster id (key) is paired with a json property
specifying the following properties:
* (optional) `resource_group` this is the resource group to use for the
storage cluster. If this is not specified, then the `resource_group`
specified in the parent is used. At least one `resource_group` must be
defined.
* (required) `hostname_prefix` is the DNS label prefix to apply to each
virtual machine and resource allocated for the storage cluster. It should
be unique.
* (required) `ssh` is the SSH admin user to create on the machine. This is not
optional in this configuration as it is in the pool specification. If you are
running Batch Shipyard on Windows, please refer to
[these instructions](85-batch-shipyard-ssh-docker-tunnel.md#ssh-keygen)
on how to generate an SSH keypair for use with Batch Shipyard.
  * (required) `username` is the admin user to create on all virtual machines
  * (optional) `ssh_public_key` is the path to a pre-existing ssh public
    key to use. If this is not specified, an RSA public/private key pair will
    be generated for use in your current working directory (with a
    non-colliding name for auto-generated SSH keys for compute pools, i.e.,
    `id_rsa_shipyard_remotefs`). On Windows only, if this is option is not
    specified, the SSH keys are not auto-generated (unless `ssh-keygen.exe`
    can be invoked in the current working directory or is in `%PATH%`).
    This option cannot be specified with `ssh_public_key_data`.
  * (optional) `ssh_public_key_data` is the raw RSA public key data in OpenSSH
    format, e.g., a string starting with `ssh-rsa ...`. Only one key may be
    specified. This option cannot be specified with `ssh_public_key`.
  * (optional) `ssh_private_key` is the path to an existing SSH private key
    to use against either `ssh_public_key` or `ssh_public_key_data` for
    connecting to storage nodes and performing operations that require SSH
    such as cluster resize and detail status. This option should only be
    specified if either `ssh_public_key` or `ssh_public_key_data` are
    specified.
  * (optional) `generated_file_export_path` is an optional path to specify
    for where to create the RSA public/private key pair.
* (optional) `public_ip` are public IP properties for each virtual machine.
  * (optional) `enabled` designates if public IPs should be assigned. The
    default is `true`. Note that if public IP is disabled, then you must
    create an alternate means for accessing the storage cluster virtual
    machines through a "jumpbox" on the virtual network. If this property
    is set to `false` (disabled), then any action requiring SSH, or the
    SSH command itself, will occur against the private IP address of the
    virtual machine.
  * (optional) `static` is to specify if static public IPs should be assigned
    to each virtual machine allocated. The default is `false` which
    results in dynamic public IP addresses. A "static" FQDN will be provided
    per virtual machine, regardless of this setting if public IPs are enabled.
* (required) `virtual_network` is the virtual network to use for the
storage cluster.
  * (required) `name` is the virtual network name
  * (optional) `resource_group` is the resource group for the virtual network.
    If this is not specified, the resource group name falls back to the
    resource group specified in the storage cluster or its parent.
  * (optional) `existing_ok` allows use of a pre-existing virtual network.
    The default is `false`.
  * (required if creating, optional otherwise) `address_space` is the
    allowed address space for the virtual network.
  * (required) `subnet` specifies the subnet properties. This subnet must
    be exclusive to the storage cluster and cannot be shared with other
    resources, including Batch compute nodes. Batch compute nodes and storage
    clusters can co-exist on the same virtual network, but should be in
    separate subnets.
    * (required) `name` is the subnet name.
    * (required) `address_prefix` is the subnet address prefix to use for
      allocation of the storage cluster file server virtual machines to.
* (required) `network_security` defines the network security rules to apply
to each virtual machine in the storage cluster.
  * (required) `ssh` is the rule for which address prefixes to allow for
    connecting to sshd port 22 on the virtual machine. In the example, `"*"`
    allows any IP address to connect. This is an array property which allows
    multiple address prefixes to be specified.
  * (optional) `nfs` rule allows the NFSv4 server port to be exposed to the
    specified address prefix. Multiple address prefixes can be specified. This
    property is ignored for glusterfs clusters.
  * (optional) `glusterfs` rule allows the various GlusterFS management and
    brick ports to be exposed to the specified address prefix. Multiple
    address prefixes can be specified. This property is ignored for nfs
    clusters.
  * (optional) `smb` rule allows the the direct host SMB port to be exposed if
    a `samba` configuration is specified under `file_server`. This requires
    Windows 2000 or later. Please note the name of this rule is `smb` which
    refers to the protocol rather than the `samba` implementation for
    providing this service on a non-Windows host.
  * (optional) `custom_inbound_rules` are custom inbound rules for other
    services that you need to expose.
    * (required) `<rule name>` is the name of the rule; the example uses
      `myrule`. Each rule name should be unique.
      * (required) `destination_port_range` is the ports on each virtual
        machine that will be exposed. This can be a single port and should
        be a string.
      * (required) `source_address_prefix` is an array of address prefixes
        to allow.
      * (required) `protocol` is the protocol to allow. Valid values are
        `tcp`, `udp` and `*` (which means any protocol).
* (required) `file_server` is the file server specification.
  * (required) `type` is the type of file server to provision. Valid values
    are `nfs` and `glusterfs`. `nfs` will provision an
    [NFSv4 server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System).
    `glusterfs` will provision a [GlusterFS server](https://www.gluster.org/).
  * (required) `mountpoint` is the path to mount the filesystem. This will
    also be the export path from the server for NFS. Note that with GlusterFS,
    if the cluster is suspended then restarted or machines are rebooted, the
    local gluster volume mount will not automatically mount upon boot, but
    will mount upon first use. This only applies to local access to the
    gluster volume mountpath directly on the virtual machine itself.
  * (optional) `mount_options` are mount options as an array to specify when
    mounting the filesystem. The examples here `noatime` and `nodiratime`
    reduce file metadata updates for access times on files and directories.
  * (optional) `server_options` is a key-value array of server options with
    the key of the filesystem `type`. In this example, we are explicitly
    definining options for `glusterfs`. `volume_name`, `volume_type` and
    `transport` are all special keywords.
    * (optional) `volume_name` is the name of the gluster volume. The default
      is `gv0`.
    * (optional) `volume_type` is the type of volume to create. If not
      specified, the default is the gluster default of a distributed volume.
      Please note that the `volume_type` specified here will have significant
      impact on performance and data availability delivered by GlusterFS for
      your workload. It is imperative to understand your data I/O and access
      patterns and selecting the proper volume type to maximize performance
      and/or availability. Although written data is durable due to managed
      disks, VM availability can cause reliability issues if a virtual machine
      fails or becomes unavailable thus resulting in unavailability of the
      brick hosting the data. You can view all of the available GlusterFS
      volume types
      [here](https://gluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Quick-Start-Guide/Architecture/#types-of-volumes).
    * (optional) `transport` is the transport type to use. The default and
      only valid value is `tcp`.
    * (optional) Other GlusterFS tuning options can be further specified here
      as key-value pairs. You can find all of the tuning options
      [here](https://gluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Administrator%20Guide/Managing%20Volumes/#tuning-volume-options).
      Please note that nfs-related options, although they can be enabled,
      are not inherently supported by Batch Shipyard. Batch Shipyard
      automatically provisions the proper GlusterFS FUSE client on compute
      nodes that require access to GlusterFS-based storage clusters.
  * (optional) `samba` defines properties required for enabling
    [SMB](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365233(v=vs.85).aspx)
    support on storage cluster nodes. This support is accomplished by
    running [Samba](https://www.samba.org/) alongside the NFS or GlusterFS
    server software. If this section is omitted, SMB access will be disabled.
    * (required) `share_name` name of the share. The path of this share is
      automatically mapped.
    * (optional) `account` is a user identity to mount the file share as.
      If this is not specified, the share will be created with guest access
      allowed and files and directories will be created and modified by the
      `nobody` account on the server.
      * (required) `username` is the username
      * (required) `password` is the password for the user. This cannot be
        null or empty.
      * (required) `uid` is the desired uid for the username
      * (required) `gid` is the desired gid for the username's group
    * (optional) `read_only` designates that the share is read only if this
      property is set to `true`. The default is `false`.
    * (optional) `create_mask` is the file creation mask as an octal string.
      The default is `"0700"`.
    * (optional) `directory_mask` is the directory creation mask as an octal
      string. The default is `"0700"`.
* (required) `vm_count` is the number of virtual machines to allocate for
the storage cluster. For `nfs` file servers, the only valid value is 1.
pNFS is not supported at this time. For `glusterfs` storage clusters, this
value must be at least 2.
* (required) `vm_size` is the virtual machine instance size to use. To attach
premium managed disks, you must use a
[premium storage compatible virtual machine size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-premium-storage#premium-storage-supported-vms).
* (optional) `fault_domains` is the number of fault domains to configure for
the availability set. This only applies to `vm_count` > `1` and must be
in the range [2, 3]. The default is `2` if not specified. Note that some
regions do not support 3 fault domains.
* (required) `vm_disk_map` is the virtual machine to managed disk mapping.
The number of entries in this map must match the `vm_count`.
  * (required) `<instance number>` is the virtual machine instance number.
    This value must be a string (although it is integral in nature).
    * (required) `disk_array` is the listing of managed disk names to attach
      to this instance. These disks must be provisioned before creating the
      storage cluster.
    * (required) `filesystem` is the filesystem to use. Valid values are
      `btrfs`, `ext4`, `ext3` and `ext2`. `btrfs` is generally stable for
      RAID-0, with better features and data integrity protection. `btrfs`
      also allows for RAID-0 expansion and is the only filesystem compatible
      with the `fs cluster expand` command.
    * (optional for single disk, required for multiple disks) `raid_level`
      is the RAID level to apply to the disks in the `disk_array`. The only
      valid value for multiple disks is `0`. Note that if you wish to expand
      the number of disks in the array in the future, you must use `btrfs`
      as the filesystem. At least two disks per virtual machine are required
      for RAID-0.
