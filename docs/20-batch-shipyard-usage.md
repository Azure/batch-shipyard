# Batch Shipyard Usage
This page contains in-depth details on how to use the Batch Shipyard tool.
Please see the [Container Image CLI](#container-cli) section for information
regarding how to use the Docker or Singularity image if not invoking the
Python script or pre-built binary directly.

## Batch Shipyard Invocation
If you installed Batch Shipyard using the `install.sh` script, then
you can invoke as:
```shell
# Change directory to batch-shipyard installed directory
./shipyard
```
You can also invoke `shipyard` from any directory if given the full path
to the script.

If you are on Windows and installed using the `install.cmd` script, then
you can invoke as:
```shell
shipyard.cmd
```

If you installed manually (i.e., took the non-recommended installation path
and did not use the installer scripts), then you will need to invoke the
Python interpreter and pass the script as an argument. For example:
```
python3 shipyard.py
```

The `-h` or `--help` option will list the available options, which are
explained below.

## Note about interoperability with Azure Tooling and Azure Batch APIs
Nearly all REST calls or commands that are issued against the normal Azure
Batch APIs and tooling such as the Azure Portal or Azure CLI will work fine
against Azure Batch Shipyard created resources. However, there are some
notable exceptions:

1. All pools must be created with Batch Shipyard if you intend to use any
Batch Shipyard functionality.
2. Please note all of the
[current limitations for other actions](99-current-limitations.md).
3. Batch Shipyard pools that are deleted outside of Batch Shipyard will not
have their associated metadata (in Azure Storage) cleaned up. Please use
the `pool del` command instead. You can use the `storage` command to clean up
orphaned data if you accidentially deleted Batch Shipyard pools outside of
Batch Shipyard.

## Commands and Sub-commands
`shipyard` (and `shipyard.py`) is invoked with a commands and sub-commands as
positional arguments, i.e.:
```shell
shipyard <command> <subcommand> <options>
```
For instance:
```shell
shipyard pool add --configdir config
# or equivalent in Linux for this particular command
SHIPYARD_CONFIGDIR=config shipyard pool add
```
Would create a pool on the Batch account as specified in the config files
found in the `config` directory. Please note that `<options>` must be
specified after the command and subcommand.

You can issue the `-h` or `--help` option at every level to view all
available options for that level and additional help text. For example:
```shell
shipyard -h
shipyard pool -h
shipyard pool add -h
```

## Shared Options
There are a set of shared options which are used between most sub-commands.
These options must be specified after the command and sub-command. These are:
```
  -y, --yes                       Assume yes for all confirmation prompts
  --raw                           Output data as returned by the service for
                                  supported operations as raw json
  --show-config                   Show configuration
  -v, --verbose                   Verbose output
  --configdir TEXT                Configuration directory where all
                                  configuration files can be found. Each
                                  config file must be named exactly the same
                                  as the regular switch option, e.g.,
                                  pool.yaml for --pool. Individually specified
                                  config options take precedence over this
                                  option. This defaults to "." if no other
                                  configuration option is specified.
  --credentials TEXT              Credentials config file

  --aad-endpoint TEXT             Azure Active Directory endpoint
  --aad-directory-id TEXT         Azure Active Directory directory (tenant) id
  --aad-application-id TEXT       Azure Active Directory application (client)
                                  id
  --aad-auth-key TEXT             Azure Active Directory authentication key
  --aad-authority-url TEXT        Azure Active Directory authority URL
  --aad-user TEXT                 Azure Active Directory user

```

* `-y` or `--yes` is to assume yes for all confirmation prompts
* `--raw` will output JSON to stdout for the command result. Only a subset
of commands support this option. Note many of the supported commands are
returning raw JSON body results from the Batch API server, thus the output
may change/break if the underlying service version changes. It is important
to pin the Batch Shipyard release to a specific version if using this feature
and perform upgrade testing/validation for your scenario and workflow between
releases. The following commands support this option:
    * `account info`
    * `account quota`
    * `cert list`
    * `fed create`
    * `fed destroy`
    * `fed list`
    * `fed jobs add`
    * `fed jobs del`
    * `fed jobs list`
    * `fed jobs term`
    * `fed jobs zap`
    * `fed pool add`
    * `fed pool remove`
    * `fed proxy status`
    * `jobs list`

    * `pool images update`
    * `pool list`
    * `pool listskus`
    * `pool nodes count`
    * `pool nodes grls`
    * `pool nodes list`
    * `pool nodes ps`
    * `pool nodes prune`
    * `pool nodes zap`
* `--show-config` will output the merged configuration prior to execution
* `-v` or `--verbose` is for verbose output
* `--configdir path` can be used instead of the individual config switches
below if all configuration files are in one directory and named after
their switch. For example, if you have a directory named `config` and under
that directory you have the files `credentials.yaml`, `config.yaml`,
`pool.yaml` and `jobs.yaml`, then you can use this argument instead of the
following individual conf options. If this parameter is not specified or
any of the individual conf options, then this paramter defaults to the
current working directory (i.e., `.`).
    * `--credentials path/to/credentials.yaml` is required for all actions
      except for a select few `keyvault` commands.
    * `--config path/to/config.yaml` is required for all actions.
    * `--pool path/to/pool.yaml` is required for most actions.
    * `--jobs path/to/jobs.yaml` is required for job-related actions.
    * `--fs path/to/fs.yaml` is required for fs-related actions and some pool
      actions.
    * `--monitor path/to/monitor.yaml` is required for resource monitoring
      actions.
* `--subscription-id` is the Azure Subscription Id associated with the
Batch account or Remote file system resources. This is only required for
creating pools with a virtual network specification or with `fs` commands.
* `--keyvault-uri` is required for all `keyvault` commands.
* `--keyvault-credentials-secret-id` is required if utilizing a credentials
config stored in Azure KeyVault
* `--aad-endpoint` is the Active Directory endpoint for the resource. Note
that this can cause conflicts for actions that require multiple endpoints
for different resources. It is better to specify endpoints explicitly in
the credential file.
* `--aad-directory-id` is the Active Directory Directory Id (or Tenant Id)
* `--aad-application-id` is the Active Directory Application Id (or Client Id)
* `--aad-auth-key` is the authentication key for the application (or client)
* `--aad-authority-url` is the Azure Active Directory Authority URL
* `--aad-user` is the Azure Active Directory user
* `--aad-password` is the Azure Active Directory password for the user
* `--aad-cert-private-key` is the Azure Active Directory Service Principal
RSA private key corresponding to the X.509 certificate for certificate-based
auth
* `--aad-cert-thumbprint` is the X.509 certificate thumbprint for Azure Active
Directory certificate-based auth

Note that only one of Active Directory Service Principal or User/Password can
be specified at once, i.e., `--aad-auth-key`, `--aad-password`, and
`--aad-cert-private-key` are mutually exclusive.

Note that the following options can be specified as environment variables
instead:

* `SHIPYARD_CONFIGDIR` in lieu of `--configdir`

The `cert` command has the following sub-commands:
```
  add     Add a certificate to a Batch account
  create  Create a certificate to use with a Batch...
  del     Deletes certificate from a Batch account
  list    List all certificates in a Batch account
```

* `add` will add a certificate to the Batch account
    * `--file` is the certificate file to add. The operation to transform
      the cert so it is acceptable for the Batch Service is determined by
      the file extension. Only `.cer`, `.pem` and `.pfx` files are supported.
      If this option is omitted, the `encryption`:`pfx` specified in the
      global configuration is used.
    * `--pem-no-certs` will convert and add the PEM file as a CER in the
      Batch service without any certificates.
    * `--pem-public-key` will convert and add the PEM file as a CER in the

      `encryption`:`pfx` will be deleted.
* `list` will list certificates in the Batch account

Note that in order to use certificates created by `cert create` for
credential encryption, you must edit your `config.yaml` to incorporate the
generated certificate and then invoke the `cert add` command. Please see the
[credential encryption](75-batch-shipyard-credential-encryption.md) guide

## `fs` Command
The `fs` command has the following sub-commands which work on two different
parts of a remote filesystem:
```
  cluster  Filesystem storage cluster in Azure actions
  disks    Managed disk actions
```

### `fs cluster` Command
`fs cluster` command has the following sub-commands:
```
  add          Create a filesystem storage cluster in Azure
  del          Delete a filesystem storage cluster in Azure
  expand       Expand a filesystem storage cluster in Azure
  orchestrate  Orchestrate a filesystem storage cluster in Azure with the...

  ssh          Interactively login via SSH to a filesystem storage cluster...
  start        Starts a previously suspended filesystem storage cluster in...
  status       Query status of a filesystem storage cluster in Azure
  suspend      Suspend a filesystem storage cluster in Azure
```
As the `fs.yaml` configuration file can contain multiple storage cluster
definitions, all `fs cluster` commands require the argument
`STORAGE_CLUSTER_ID` after any option below is specified targeting the
storage cluster to perform actions against.

* `add` will create a remote fs cluster as defined in the fs config file
* `del` will delete a remote fs cluster as defined in the fs config file
    * `--delete-resource-group` will delete the entire resource group that
      contains the server. Please take care when using this option as any
      resource in the resoure group is deleted which may be other resources
      that are not Batch Shipyard related.
    * `--delete-data-disks` will delete attached data disks
    * `--delete-virtual-network` will delete the virtual network and all of
      its subnets
    * `--generate-from-prefix` will attempt to generate all resource names
      using conventions used. This is helpful when there was an issue with
      cluster creation/deletion and the original virtual machine(s) resources
      cannot be enumerated. Note that OS disks and data disks cannot be
      deleted with this option. Please use `fs disks del` to delete disks
      that may have been used in the storage cluster.
    * `--no-wait` does not wait for deletion completion. It is not recommended
      to use this parameter.
* `expand` expands the number of disks used by the underlying filesystems on
the file server.
    * `--no-rebalance` rebalances the data and metadata among the disks for
      better data spread and performance after the disk is added to the array.
* `orchestrate` will create the remote disks and the remote fs cluster as
defined in the fs config file
* `resize` resizes the storage cluster with additional virtual machines as
specified in the configuration. This is an experimental feature.
* `ssh` will interactively log into a virtual machine in the storage cluster.
If neither `--cardinal` or `--hostname` are specified, `--cardinal 0` is
assumed.
    * `COMMAND` is an optional argument to specify the command to run. If your
      command has switches, preface `COMMAND` with double dash as per POSIX
      convention, e.g., `fs cluster ssh mycluster -- df -h`.
    * `--cardinal` is the zero-based cardinal number of the virtual machine in
      the storage cluster to connect to.
    * `--hostname` is the hostname of the virtual machine in the storage
      cluster to connect to
    * `--tty` allocates a pseudo-terminal

## Example Invocations
```shell
shipyard pool add --credentials credentials.yaml --config config.yaml --pool pool.yaml

# ... or if all config files are in the current working directory named as above ...
# (note this is strictly not necessary as Batch Shipyard will search the
# current working directory if the options above are not explicitly specified

shipyard pool add --configdir .

# ... or use environment variables instead

SHIPYARD_CONFIGDIR=. shipyard pool add
```
The above invocation will add the pool specified to the Batch account. Notice
that the options and shared options are given after the command and
sub-command and not before.

```shell
shipyard jobs add --configdir .

# ... or use environment variables instead

SHIPYARD_CONFIGDIR=. shipyard jobs add
```
The above invocation will add the jobs specified in the jobs.yaml file to
the designated pool.

```shell
shipyard data files stream --configdir . --filespec job1,task-00000,stdout.txt

# ... or use environment variables instead

SHIPYARD_CONFIGDIR=. shipyard data files stream --filespec job1,task-00000,stdout.txt
```
The above invocation will stream the stdout.txt file from the job `job1` and
task `task1` from a live compute node. Because all portions of the
`--filespec` option are specified, the tool will not prompt for any input.

## <a name="container-cli"></a>Batch Shipyard Container Image CLI Invocation
If using either the Docker image [alfpark/batch-shipyard:latest-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/alfpark/batch-shipyard)
or the Singularity image
[shub://alfpark/batch-shipyard-singularity:cli](https://www.singularity-hub.org/collections/204),
then you would invoke Batch Shipyard as:

```shell
# if using Docker
docker run --rm -it alfpark/batch-shipyard:latest-cli \
    <command> <subcommand> <options...>

# if using Singularity
singularity run shub://alfpark/batch-shipyard-singularity:cli \
    <command> <subcommand> <options...>
```

where `<command> <subcommand>` is the command and subcommand as described
above and `<options...>` are any additional options to pass to the
`<subcommand>`.

Invariably, you will need to pass config files to the tool which reside
on the host and not in the container by default. Please use the `-v` volume
mount option with `docker run` or `-B` bind option with `singularity run`
to mount host directories inside the container. For example, if your Batch
Shipyard configs are stored in the host path
`/home/user/batch-shipyard-configs` you could modify the invocations as:

```shell
# if using Docker
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /home/user/batch-shipyard-configs:/configs \
    -w /configs \
    alfpark/batch-shipyard:latest-cli \
    <command> <subcommand> <options...>

# if using Singularity
singularity run \
    -B /home/user/batch-shipyard-configs:/configs \
    --pwd /configs \
    shub://alfpark/batch-shipyard-singularity:cli \
    <command> <subcommand> <options...>
```

Notice that we specified the working directory as `-w` for Docker or
`--pwd` for Singularity to match the `/configs` container path.

Additionally, if you wish to ingress data from locally accessible file
systems using Batch Shipyard, then you will need to map additional volume
mounts as appropriate from the host to the container.

Batch Shipyard may generate files with some actions, such as adding a SSH
user or creating a pool with an SSH user. In this case, you will need to
create a volume mount with the `-v` (or `-B`) option and also ensure that the
pool specification `ssh` object has a `generated_file_export_path` property
set to the volume mount path. This will ensure that generated files will be
written to the host and persisted after the docker container exits. Otherwise,
