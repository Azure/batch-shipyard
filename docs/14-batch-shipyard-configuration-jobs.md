# Batch Shipyard Jobs Configuration
This page contains in-depth details on how to configure the jobs
configuration file for Batch Shipyard.

## Considerations
- By default, containers are executed with the working directory set to the
Azure Batch task working directory (or `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR`). This
default is set such that all files written to this path (or any child paths)
are persisted to the host. This behavior can be changed through the options
`default_working_dir` or to explicitly set the working dir with the
container runtime respective switch to `additional_docker_run_options`
or `additional_singularity_options`.
- Container logs are automatically captured to `stdout.txt` and `stderr.txt`
within the `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_DIR`. You can egress these logs using the
`data files task` command (e.g.,
`data files task --filespec myjobid,mytaskid,stdout.txt`).

`job_specifications` array consists of jobs to create.

* (required) `id` is the job id to create. If the job already exists, the
specified `tasks` under the job will be added to the existing job.
* (optional) `auto_complete` enables auto-completion of the job for which
the specified tasks are run under. In non-`native` mode and when run with
multi-instance tasks, this performs automatic cleanup of the Docker container
which is run in detached mode. It is not necessary to set `auto_complete` to
`true` with `native` container supported pools to clean up Docker containers
with multi-instance tasks. However, it is not necessary to set `auto_complete`
to `true` for Singularity-based multi-instance tasks. The default is `false`.
If creating a job `recurrence`, utilizing `auto_complete` is one way to have
recurrent job instances created from a schedule to complete such that the
next job recurrence can be created.
* (optional) `environment_variables` under the job are environment variables
which will be applied to all tasks operating under the job. Note that
environment variables are not expanded and are passed as-is. You will need
to source the environment file `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR/.shipyard.envlist`
in a shell within the Docker `command` or `entrypoint` if you want any
environment variables to be expanded. This behavior does not apply to
`native` container pools and Singularity images.
* (optional) `environment_variables_keyvault_secret_id` under the job are
environment variables stored in KeyVault that should be applied to all tasks
operating under the job. The secret stored in KeyVault must be a valid
YAML/JSON string, e.g., `{ "env_var_name": "env_var_value" }`.
* (optional) `max_task_retries` sets the maximum number of times that
Azure Batch should retry all tasks in this job for. By default, Azure Batch
does not retry tasks that fail (i.e. `max_task_retries` is 0). Note that
`remove_container_after_exit` must be `true` (the default) in order for
retries to work properly.
* (optional) `max_wall_time` sets the maximum wallclock time that the job
can stay active for (i.e., time period after it has been created). By
default, or if not set, the job may stay active for an infinite period. The
format for this property is a timedelta with a string representation of
"d.HH:mm:ss". Note that the job will transition to completed state after
the maximum wall clock time is reached along with termination of any
running tasks.
* (optional) `retention_time` sets the timedelta to retain any tasks
directories under the job on the compute node where it ran after the task
completes. The format for this property is a timedelta with a string
representation of "d.HH:mm:ss". For example, "1.12:00:00" would allow the
compute node to clean up all of the task directories under this job
36 hours after the task completed. The default, if unspecified, is 7 days.
* (optional) `priority` is an integral number that indicates the job priority.
Tasks within jobs with higher priority are run ahead of those with lower
priority, however, tasks that are already running with lower priority are
not preempted. Valid values are within the range of [-1000, 1000] and the
default is `0`.
* (optional) `user_identity` property is to define which user to run the
container as. By default, if this property is not defined, the container will
be run as the root user. However, it may be required to run the container
with a different user, especially if integrating with storage cluster and
shared file systems. All first-level properties within `user_identity` are
mutually exclusive of one another.
    * (optional) `default_pool_admin` specifies if the container should be
      run with the default pool (compute node) administrator user that Azure
      Batch automatically configures upon compute node start. This user will
      have passwordless sudo access.
    * (optional) `specific_user` specifies to run the container as a specific
      user.
        * (required) `uid` is the user id of the user
        * (required) `gid` is the group id of the user
* (optional) `auto_pool` will create a compute pool on demand for
the job as specified in the pool configuration. Note that storage resources
required by Batch Shipyard may not be automatically cleaned up when using
autopools. Utilizing `jobs term` or `jobs del` without any jobid scoping
will attempt to clean up storage resources. Otherwise, you will need to use
`storage del` or `storage clear` to clean up storage resources manually.
    * (optional) `pool_lifetime` specifies the lifetime of the pool. Valid
      values are `job` and `job_schedule`. `job_schedule` is only valid if
      the `recurrence` property is also specified. The default is `job`.
    * (optional) `keep_alive` specifies if the pool should be kept even after
      its lifetime expires. The default is `false`. Note that setting this
      value to `false` and setting `auto_complete` to `true` will automatically
      delete the compute pool once all tasks under the job complete.
* (optional) `recurrence` will create a schedule to run the job and tasks at
a set interval.
    * (required) `schedule` is the recurring schedule specification
        * (optional) `do_not_run_until` is a datetime specification that
          prevents the job from running until this date and time is reached.
          This string should be in a
          [parseable date time format](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html).
          The default is to run immediately (i.e., `null`).
        * (optional) `do_not_run_after` is a datetime specification that
          prevents the job from running after this date and time is reached.
          This string should be in a
          [parseable date time format](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html).
          The default has no limit (i.e., `null`).
        * (optional) `start_window` is the time window for when the job should
          be created according to this schedule to the maximum delta for which
          the job can be created. This is essentially the scheduling window for
          the job. If this property is non-`null` and the job cannot be created
          within this time window, then the job scheduling opportunity is
          forfeit until the next recurrence. The default is no limit
          (i.e., `null`). If the `start_window` exceeds the
          `recurrence_interval` then this is logically equivalent to setting
          the `start_window` to `null`. The format for this property is a
          timedelta with a string representation of "d.HH:mm:ss".
        * (required) `recurrence_interval` is the recurrence interval for the
          job. The format for this property is a timedelta with a string
          representation of "d.HH:mm:ss". The minimum value is `00:01:00` or
          1 minute. Note that a recurring job schedule can only have at most
          one active job. If a prior recurrence of the job is still active when
          the next recurrence fires, no new job is created. An important
          implication is that even if you set this property to a minimum value
          of 1 minute, there may be delays in completing the job and triggering
          the next which may artificially increase the time between
          recurrences. It is important to set either the `auto_complete` or the
          `job_manager`:`monitor_task_completion` setting to `true` if your
          tasks have no logic to terminate or delete the parent job.
    * (optional) `job_manager` property controls the job manager execution. The
      job manager is the task that is automatically created and run on a
      compute node that submits the `tasks` at the given `recurrence_interval`.
        * (optional) `allow_low_priority_node` allows the job manager to run
          on a low priority node. The default is `true`. Sometimes it is
          necessary to guarantee that the job manager is not preempted, if so,
          set this value to `false` and ensure that your pool has dedicated
          nodes provisioned.
        * (optional) `run_exclusive` forces the job manager to run on a compute
          node where there are no other tasks running. The default is `false`.
          This is only relevant when the pool's `max_tasks_per_node` setting is
          greater than 1.
        * (optional) `monitor_task_completion` allows the job manager to
          monitor the tasks in the job for completion instead of relying on
          `auto_complete`. The advantage for doing so is that the job can move
          much more quickly into completed state thus allowing the next job
          recurrence to be created for very small values of
          `recurrence_interval`. In order to properly utilize this feature,
          you must either set your pool's `max_tasks_per_node` to greater
          than 1 or have more than one compute node in your pool. If neither
          of these conditions are met, then the tasks that the job manager
          creates will be blocked as there will be no free scheduling slots
          to accommodate them (since the job manager task occupies a
          scheduling slot itself). The default is `false`. Setting both
          this value and `auto_complete` to `true` will  result in
          `auto_complete` as `true` behavior.
* (optional) `allow_run_on_missing_image` allows tasks with a Docker image
reference that was not pre-loaded on to the compute node via
`global_resources`:`docker_images` in the global configuration to be able to
run. Note that you should attempt to specify all Docker images that you intend
to run in the `global_resources`:`docker_images` property in the global
configuration to minimize scheduling to task execution latency.
* (optional) `remove_container_after_exit` property specifies if all
containers under the job should be automatically removed/cleaned up after
the task exits. Note that this only cleans up the Docker container and not
the associated Batch task. This defaults to `true`. This option only applies
to Docker containers.
* (optional) `shm_size` property specifies the size of `/dev/shm` in all
containers under the job. The default is `64m`. The postfix unit can be
designated as `b` (bytes), `k` (kilobytes), `m` (megabytes), or `g`
(gigabytes). This value may need to be increased from the default of `64m`
for certain Docker applications, including multi-instance tasks using Intel
MPI (see [issue #8](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/issues/8)). This
option only applies to Docker containers.
* (optional) `infiniband` designates if all tasks under the job require
access to the Infiniband/RDMA devices on the host. Note that this will
automatically force containers to use the host network stack. If this
property is set to `true`, ensure that the `pool_specification` property
`inter_node_communication_enabled` is set to `true`. If this property is
not set, it will default to `true` if the task is destined for an RDMA-enabled
compute pool and `inter_node_communication_enabled` is set to `true`. This
option has no effect on `native` container support pools as it is
automtically enabled by the system.
* (optional) `gpu` designates if all containers under the job require access
to the GPU devices on the host. If this property is set to `true`, Docker
containers are instantiated via `nvidia-docker` and the appropriate options
are passed for Singularity containers. This requires N-series VM instances.
If this property is not set, it will default to `true` if the task
is destined for a compute pool with GPUs. This option has no effect on
`native` container support pools as it is automatically enabled by the
system.
* (optional) `exit_conditions` sets the exit conditions for all tasks
under this job. Currently only the `default` exit conditions can be set
which react to any non-zero exit code.
    * (required) `default` is the default exit conditions. Meaning if any
      task in this job exits with a non-zero exit code, perform the following
      actions below.
        * (optional) `job_action` is the job action to perform if any task
          in this job exits with a non-zero exit code. This can be set to
          `none`, `disable`, or `terminate`. The default is `none`.
        * (optional) `dependency_action` is the dependency action to perform
          if any task in this job exits with a non-zero exit code. This can
          be set to `block` or `satisfy`. The default is `block`.
* (optional) `data_volumes` is an array of `data_volume` aliases as defined
in the global configuration file. These volumes will be mounted in
all containers under the job.
* (optional) `shared_data_volumes` is an array of `shared_data_volume`
aliases as defined in the global configuration file. These volumes will be
mounted in all containers under the job.
* (optional) `auto_scratch` will enable on-demand distributed scratch
space creation across all dedicated or low priority nodes in the associated
pool for this job. This scratch will be available at the location
`$AZ_BATCH_TASK_DIR/auto_scratch` within the container. The scratch space
is cleaned up automatically on job termination or deletion. This option
requires setting the property `per_job_auto_scratch` to `true` in the
corresponding pool configuration.
* (optional) `input_data` is an object containing data that should be
ingressed for the job. Any `input_data` defined at this level will be
downloaded for this job which can be run on any number of compute nodes
depending upon the number of constituent tasks and repeat invocations. However,
`input_data` is only downloaded once per job invocation on a compute node.
For example, if `job-1`:`task-1` is run on compute node A and then
`job-1`:`task-2` is run on compute node B, then this `input_data` is ingressed
to both compute node A and B. However, if `job-1`:`task-3` is then run on
compute node A after `job-1`:`task-1`, then the `input_data` is not
transferred again. This object currently supports `azure_batch` and
`azure_storage` as members.
    * `azure_batch` will transfer data from a compute node that has run the
      specified task. Note that there is no implied dependency. It is
      recommended to specify a `depends_on` in order to ensure that the
      specified task runs before this one (note that `depends_on` requires
      that the upstream task must exist within the same job). Additionally,
      the compute node which ran the task must not have been deleted or
      resized out of the pool.
        * (required) `job_id` the job id of the task
        * (required) `task_id` the id of the task to fetch files from
        * (optional) `include` is an array of include filters
        * (optional) `exclude` is an array of exclude filters
        * (required) `destination` is the destination path to place the files
    * `azure_storage` contains the following members:
        * (required) `storage_account_settings` contains a storage account link
          as defined in the credentials config.
        * (required) `remote_path` is required when downloading from Azure
          Storage. This path on Azure includes either the container or file
          share path along with all virtual directories.
        * (required) `local_path` is required when downloading from Azure
          Storage. This specifies where the files should be downloaded to on
          the compute node. If you require ingressing to a shared file system
          location like a GlusterFS volume, then use the global configuration
          `files` property and the `data ingress` command.
        * (optional) `is_file_share` denotes if the `remote_path` is on a
          file share. This defaults to `false`.
        * (optional) `include` property defines optional include filters.
        * (optional) `exclude` property defines optional exclude filters.
        * (optional) `blobxfer_extra_options` are any extra options to pass to
          `blobxfer`.
* (optional) `default_working_dir` defines the default working directory
when the container executes. Valid values for this property are `batch` and
`container`. If `batch` is selected, the working directory for the container
execution is set to the Azure Batch task working directory, or
`$AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR`. If `container` is selected, the working
directory for the container execution is not explicitly set. The default is
`batch` if not specified. If you wish to specify a different working
directory, you can pass the appropriate working directory parameter to the
container runtime through either `additional_docker_run_options` or
`additional_singularity_options`. A working directory option specified within
that property takes precedence over this option. Note that this option does
not work in `native` mode currently; `native` mode will always override this
option to `batch`.
* (optional) `restrict_default_bind_mounts` will restrict the mapped
host directories into the container. If this property is set to `true`,
only the `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_DIR` is mapped from the host into the container.
This is useful when it is necessary to restrict the scope of the Azure Batch
directory hierarchy is exposed to the container and in particular when in used
in combination with isolation models such as Hyper-V or Kata containers.
Note that if shared file systems or other mounts are placed in the
`$AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR` then enabling this option may prevent tasks
from accessing required data and working correctly. This option has no
effect on native container pools. The default is `false`.
* (optional) `force_enable_task_dependencies` will flag this job as having
task dependencies explicitly even if no `tasks` have dependencies specified.
This is useful for scenarios where the same job is used for tasks at a
later time that do have dependencies and/or are dependent on tasks
previously added to the same job. The default is `false`.
* (optional) `federation_constraints` defines properties to apply to the job
and all tasks (i.e., the task group) when submitting the job to a federation.
Please see the [federation guide](68-batch-shipyard-federation.md) for more
information and terminology definitions.
    * (optional) `pool` properties defines pool-level constraints for the
      job.
        * (optional) `autoscale` properties define autoscale constraints.
          `allow` cannot be set to `false` and `exclusive` to `true`.
            * (required) `allow` specifies if the job is allowed to be
              scheduled on an autoscale-enabled pool. The default, if not
              specified, is `true`.
            * (required) `exclusive` specifies if the job can only be
              scheduled to an autoscale-enabled pool. The default, if not
              specified, is `false`.
        * (optional) `low_priority_nodes` properties define low priority
          constraints. Both of these properties are enforced on a best-effort
          basis. `allow` cannot be set to `false` and `exclusive` to `true`.
            * (required) `allow` specifies if the job is allowed to run on
              pools with low priority nodes. The default, if not specified,
              is `true`.
            * (required) `exclusive` specifies if the job can only be
              scheduled to pools with low priority nodes.  The default,
              if not specified, is `false`.
        * (optional) `native` specifies if the job must be run on native
          container pools. The default, if not specified, is `null` which
          adopts the pool settings as submitted with the job.
        * (optional) `windows` specifies if the job must run on Windows
          pools. The default, if not specified, is `null` which adopts the
          pool settings as submitted with the job.
        * (optional) `location` specifies a specific location constraint.
          The location must be a proper ARM name and not the "display name".
          For example, the region "East US" is the display name, while the
          proper name is `eastus`. To get a listing of ARM region names, they
          can be queried via the Azure CLI command
          `az account list-locations -o table`. The default, if not specified,
          is `null` which does not impose a region constraint.
        * (optional) `container_registries` defines container registry
          constraints. All container images specified within each task group
          for a job must have the corresponding container registry login
          information loaded for each possible target pool within the
          federation; the image itself does not need to be pre-loaded on each
          individual compaute node (but can be pre-loaded to improve task
          startup times - please see the global configuration doc for more
          information under `global_resources`).
            * (optional) `private_docker_hub` specifies if any container image
              within the task group that reside on Docker Hub require a
              Docker Hub login. The default, if not specified, is `false` -
              which means all container images that refer to Docker Hub are
              public and require no login.
            * (optional) `public` is a list of registries that do not require
              a login. If desired, you can create non-Docker Hub repos that
              do not have logins. You will need to specify any tasks within the
              group referencing images that do not require logins.
        * (optional) `max_active_task_backlog` defines the maximum active
          task backlog constraint.
            * (optional) `ratio` is the maximum ratio as defined by:
              `active tasks in pool / available scheduling slots in pool`.
              Thus, if there are 8 active tasks waiting, with 4 available
              scheduling slots for a particluar pool, the backlog ratio for
              this pool would be `2`. Thus if this property was set to `1`,
              then this particular pool would be skipped as a potential
              target for the job. The default, if not specified, is `null`
              or that there is no `ratio` and scheduling of task groups can
              target any pool with any backlog amount.
            * (optional) `autoscale_exempt` specifies if autoscale-enabled
              pools should not be subject to this constraint while in
              allocation state `steady` and the number of available slots
              is 0. This is to ensure that autoscale pools would be able to
              be targetted for jobs even if the pool currently contains no
              nodes. The default, if not specified, is `true`.
        * (optional) `custom_image_arm_id` defines the custom image ARM
          image id that must be used as the pool host OS for this task group
          to be scheduled.
        * (optional) `virtual_network_arm_id` defines that a pool must be
          joined with this specific ARM subnet id to be scheduled with this
          task group.
    * (optional) `compute_node` are compute node level specific constraints.
        * (optional) `vm_size` defines an
          [Azure Batch supported Azure VM size](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-pool-vm-sizes)
          that this task group must be scheduled to. The default, if not
          specified, is `null` or no restriction. This property is mutually
          exclusive of `cores` and/or `memory` constraints below.
        * (optional) `cores` defines scheduling behavior for the number of
          cores required for each task within the task group. This property
          is mutually exclusive of the `vm_size` constraint.
            * (optional) `amount` is the number of cores required for each
              task in the task group. Azure Batch schedules to scheduling
              slots and does not schedule to cores. This limitation leads to
              the next constraint. The default, if not specified, is
              `null` or no restriction.
            * (optional) `schedulable_variance` is the maximum
              "over-provisioned" core capacity allowed for each task which
              constructs a valid compute node core range target of
              [amount, amount * (1 + schedulable_variance)]. For example,
              if `amount` is set to `2` and this property is set to `1` (which
              is equivalent to 100% of the specified `amount`) then the job's
              tasks will only target pools with compute nodes with a range of
              cores [2, 4], inclusive. The default value, if not specified,
              is `null` which infers no upper-bound limit on the core range.
              A value of `0` infers exact match required for the specified
              `amount`.
        * (optional) `memory` defines scheduling behvior for the amount of
          memory required for each task within the task group. This property
          is mutually exclusive of the `vm_size` constraint.
            * (optional) `amount` is the amount of memory required for each
              task in the task group. This value should be a string where
              the amount is followed directly by a suffix `b`, `k`, `m`, `g`,
              or `t`. Azure Batch schedules to scheduling slots and
              does not schedule to memory. This limitation leads to
              the next constraint. The default, if not specified, is
              `null` or no restriction.
            * (optional) `schedulable_variance` is the maximum
              "over-provisioned" memory capacity allowed for each task which
              constructs a valid compute node memory range target of
              [amount, amount * (1 + schedulable_variance)]. For example,
              if `amount` is set to `4096m` and this property is set to `1`
              (which is equivalent to 100% of the specified `amount`) then
              the job's tasks will only target pools with compute nodes with
              a range of memory [4096m, 8192m], inclusive. The default value,
              if not specified, is `null` which infers no upper-bound limit
              on the memory range. A value of `0` infers exact match
              required for the specified `amount`. It is not recommended to
              set this value to `0` for a `memory` constraint.
        * (optional) `exclusive` specifies if each task within the task group
          must not be co-scheduled with other running tasks on compute nodes.
          Effectively this excludes pools as scheduling targets that have
          been provisioned with the setting `max_tasks_per_node` greater
          than `1`.
        * (optional) `gpu` specifies if tasks within the task group should
          be scheduled on a compute node that has a GPU. Note that specifying
          this property as `true` does not implicitly create tasks that
          can utilize the GPU in a containerized context (e.g., nvidia-docker).
          You must, instead, specify the `gpu` property as `true` at the job
          or task-level to enable GPU access within a container task.
        * (optional) `infiniband` specifies if tasks within the task group
          should be scheduled on a compute node that has a RDMA/IB. Note that
          specifying this property as `true` does not implicitly create tasks
          that can utilize the RDMA/IB device with Intel MPI in a
          containerized context. You must, instead, specify the `infiniband`
          property as `true` at the job or task-level to access RDMA/IB
          within a container task.

The required `tasks` property is an array of tasks to add to the job:

* (optional) `id` is the task id. Note that if the task `id` is null or
empty then a generic task id will be assigned. The generic task id is
formatted as dictated by the `autogenerated_task_id` setting in the
global configuration; if this setting is not set, then by default the
task id will be formatted as `task-NNNNN` where `NNNNN` starts from
`00000` and is increased by 1 for each task added to the same job. If
there are more than `99999` autonamed tasks in a job then the numbering
is not padded for tasks exceeding 5 digits. This behavior can be
controlled by the `autogenerated_task_id` setting in the global
configuration. `id` should not be specified in conjunction with the
`task_factory` property as `id`s will be automatically generated. A
task `id` may not exceed 64 characters in length.
* (required if using a Docker image) `docker_image` is the Docker image to
use for this task.
* (required if using a Singularity image) `singularity_image` is the
Singularity image to use for this task. Due to Singularity limitations, if the
image specified at a certain URI changes, the image will automatically be
pulled again from the registry the next time that the image is used in a task
which can lead to increased latency to begin task execution if the image
differs from a previous pull, and lead to potential inconsistencies between
task executions.
* (optional) `task_factory` is a way to dyanmically generate tasks. This
  enables parameter sweeps and task repetition without having to
  explicitly generate a task array with different parameters for the
  `command`. Please see the
  [Task Factory Guide](35-batch-shipyard-task-factory-merge-task.md) for more
  information.
    * (optional) `parametric_sweep` is a parameter sweep task factory. This
      has multiple modes of task generation and only one may be specified.
        * (optional) `product` is a potentially nested parameter generator.
          If one set of `start` (inclusive), `stop` (exclusive), `step`
          properties are specified (all required parameters), then a simple
          range of values are generated. In the example above, the integers
          `0` to `9` are provided as arguments to the `command` property.
          If another set of `start`, `stop`, `step` properties are
          specified, then these are nested within the prior set.
        * (optional) `product_iterables` is similar to `product` but will
          use iterables to generate the parameters.
        * (optional) `combinations` generates `length` subsequences of
          parameters from the `iterable`. Combinations are emitted in
          lexicographic sort order.
            * (required) `iterable` is the iterable to generate parameters
              from
            * (required) `length` is the subsequence "r" length
            * (optional) `replacement` allows individual elements to be
              repeated more than once.
        * (optional) `permutations` generates `length` permutations of
          parameters from the `iterable`. Permutations are emitted in
          lexicographic sort order.
            * (required) `iterable` is the iterable to generate parameters
              from
            * (required) `length` is the subsequence "r" length
        * (optional) `zip` generates parameters where the i-th parameter
          contains the i-th element from each iterable.
    * (optional) `random` is a random task factory. This has multiple
      modes of task generation and only one may be specified.
        * (required) `generate` will generate N number of random values and
          thus N number of tasks
        * (optional) `seed` will initialize the internal state to the
          specified seed
        * (optional) `integer` will generate random integers
            * (required) `start` is the inclusive beginning of the random
              range
            * (required) `stop` is the exclusive end of the random range
            * (required) `step` is the stepping between potential random
              numbers within the range
        * (optional) `distribution` will generate random floating point
          values given a distribution. The
          [distribution](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/random.html#real-valued-distributions)
          can be one of (please refer to the docs for required properties):
            * (optional) `uniform` for uniform distribution
            * (optional) `triangular` for triangular distribution
            * (optional) `beta` for beta distribution
            * (optional) `exponential` for exponential distribution
            * (optional) `gamma` for gamma distribution
            * (optional) `gauss` for Gaussian distribution
            * (optional) `lognormal` for Log normal distribution
            * (optional) `pareto` for Pareto distribution
            * (optional) `weibull` for Weibull distribution
    * (optional) `file` is a file-based task factory. This will generate a
      task for each file enumerated. The `command` should be keyword
      formatted with any combination of: `file_path`,
      `file_path_with_container`, `file_name`, or `file_name_no_extension`.
      Please see the
      [Task Factory Guide](35-batch-shipyard-task-factory-merge-task.md)
      for more information.
        * (required) `azure_storage` specifies the Azure Storage settings
          to use for the file task factory.
            * (required) `storage_account_settings` is the storage account
              link to enumerate files from
            * (required) `remote_path` is the remote Azure Storage path to
              enumerate files from.
            * (optional) `is_file_share` denotes if the `remote_path` is on a
              file share. This defaults to `false`.
            * (optional) `include` are include filters
            * (optional) `exclude` are exclude filters
            * (required) `task_filepath` specifies how to place the file
              relative to the task working directory (i.e.,
              `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR`). This can be one of:
              `file_path`, `file_path_with_container`, `file_name`, or
              `file_name_no_extension`.
    * (optional) `custom` is a custom task factory where the logic for
      parameter generation exists in a custom Python module that can be
      imported at runtime. Please see the
      [Task Factory Guide](35-batch-shipyard-task-factory-merge-task.md)
      for more information.
        * (required) `module` specifies the Python module to import. This
          must be valid and resolvable by `importlib`. This module must
          define a `generate` generator function that is callable with
          `*args` and `**kwargs`. The `generate` generator function must
          yield an iterable to pass to the `command` for transformation.
        * (optional) `package` is required if `module` is specified in
          relative terms (i.e., the anchor for package resolution).
        * (optional) `input_args` are positional arguments to pass to the
          `generate` generator function.
        * (optional) `input_kwargs` are keyword arguments to pass to the
          `generate` generator function. This should be a dictionary where
          all keys are strings.
    * (optional) `repeat` will create N number of identical tasks.
* (optional) `depends_on` is an array of task ids for which this container
invocation (task) depends on and must run to successful completion prior
to this task executing. Note that when a `task_factory` is specified, all
tasks generated by the task factory depend on the listed dependent tasks.
You cannot specify another task factory to depend on, only discrete tasks.
* (optional) `depends_on_range` is an array with exactly two integral
elements containing a task `id` range for which this task is dependent
upon, i.e., the start `id` and the end `id` for which this task depends
on. Although task `id`s are always strings, the dependent task `id`s for
ranges must be expressed by their integral representation for this
property. This also implies that task `id`s for which this task depends
on must be integral in nature. For example, if `depends_on_range` is set
to `[1, 10]` (note the integral members), then there should be task
`id`s of `"1"`, `"2"`, ... `"10"` within the job. Once these dependent
tasks complete successfully, then this specified task will execute. Note that
when a `task_factory` is specified all tasks generated by the task factory
depend on the range of dependent tasks. You cannot specify another task
factory to depend on, only a range of discrete tasks.
* (optional) `singularity_execution` defines the invocation pattern for
the Singularity container. This option only applies to Singularity containers.
    * (optional) `cmd` is the singularity command to use. This
      can be either `exec` or `run`. The default is `exec`.
    * (optional) `elevated` if set to `true` will run the command elevated
      as root. The default is `false`.
* (optional) `additional_singularity_options` are any additional options
to pass to the `singularity_cmd`. This option only applies to Singularity
containers.
* (optional) `name` is the name to assign to the Docker container. If not
specified, the value of the `id` property will be used for `name`. This
option only applies to Docker containers.
* (optional) `labels` is an array of labels to apply to the container.
This option only applies to Docker containers.
* (optional) `environment_variables` are any additional task-specific
environment variables that should be applied to the container. For
Docker non-`native` pools, note that environment variables are not expanded
and are passed as-is. You will need to source the environment file
`$AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR/.shipyard.envlist` in a shell within the
Docker `command` or `entrypoint` if you want any environment variables
to be expanded. This behavior does not apply to `native` container pools and
Singularity images.
* (optional) `environment_variables_keyvault_secret_id` are any additional
task-specific environment variables that should be applied to the
container but are stored in KeyVault. The secret stored in KeyVault must
be a valid YAML/JSON string, e.g., `{ "env_var_name": "env_var_value" }`.
* (optional) `ports` is an array of port specifications that should be
exposed to the host. This option only applies to Docker containers.
* (optional) `data_volumes` is an array of `data_volume` aliases as defined
in the global configuration file. These volumes will be mounted in the
container. Volumes specified here will be merged with any job-level
volumes specified.
* (optional) `shared_data_volumes` is an array of `shared_data_volume`
aliases as defined in the global configuration file. These volumes will be
mounted in the container. Volumes specified here will be merged with any
job-level volumes specified.
* (optional) `resource_files` is an array of resource files that should be
downloaded as part of the task. Each array entry contains the following
information:
    * `file_path` is the path within the task working directory to place the
      file on the compute node.
    * `blob_source` is an accessible HTTP/HTTPS URL. This need not be an Azure
      Blob Storage URL.
    * `file_mode` if the file mode to set for the file on the compute node.
      This is optional.
* (optional) `input_data` is an object containing data that should be
ingressed for this specific task. This object currently supports
`azure_batch` and  `azure_storage` as members. Note for multi-instance
tasks, transfer of `input_data` is only applied to the task running the
application command.
    * `azure_batch` will transfer data from a compute node that has run the
      specified task. Note that there is no implied dependency. It is
      recommended to specify a `depends_on` in order to ensure that the
      specified task runs before this one (note that `depends_on` requires
      that the upstream task must exist within the same job). Additionally,
      the compute node which ran the task must not have been deleted or
      resized out of the pool.
        * (required) `job_id` the job id of the task
        * (required) `task_id` the id of the task to fetch files from
        * (optional) `include` is an array of include filters
        * (optional) `exclude` is an array of exclude filters
        * (optional) `destination` is the destination path to place the files.
          If `destination` is not specified at this level, then files are
          defaulted to download into `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR`.
    * `azure_storage` contains the following members:
        * (required) `storage_account_settings` contains a storage account link
          as defined in the credentials config.
        * (required) `remote_path` is required when downloading from Azure
          Storage. This path on Azure includes either the container or file
          share path along with all virtual directories.
        * (required) `local_path` is required when downloading from Azure
          Storage. This specifies where the files should be downloaded to on
          the compute node. Unlike the job-level version of `input_data`,
          this property can be ommitted. If `local_path` is not specified
          at this level, then files are defaulted to download into
          `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_WORKING_DIR`. Please note that you should not
          specify a location that is on a shared file system. If you
          require ingressing to a shared file system location like a
          GlusterFS volume, then use the global configuration `files`
          property and the `data ingress` command.
        * (optional) `is_file_share` denotes if the `remote_path` is on a
          file share. This defaults to `false`.
        * (optional) `include` property defines optional include filters.
        * (optional) `exclude` property defines optional exclude filters.
        * (optional) `blobxfer_extra_options` are any extra options to pass to
          `blobxfer`.
* (optional) `output_data` is an object containing data that should be
egressed for this specific task if and only if the task completes
successfully. This object currently only supports `azure_storage` as a
member. Note for multi-instance tasks, transfer of `output_data` is only
applied to the task running the application command.
    * `azure_storage` contains the following members:
        * (required) `storage_account_settings` contains a storage account link
          as defined in the credentials config.
        * (required) `remote_path` is required when uploading to Azure
          Storage. This path on Azure includes either the container or file
          share path along with all virtual directories.
        * (required) `local_path` is required when uploading from Azure
          Storage. This specifies where the files should be uploaded from
          the compute node to Azure Storage. If this property is not
          specified, then `source` is defaulted to `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_DIR`.
        * (optional) `is_file_share` denotes if the `remote_path` is on a
          file share. This defaults to `false`.
        * (optional) `include` property defines optional include filters.
        * (optional) `exclude` property defines optional exclude filters.
        * (optional) `blobxfer_extra_options` are any extra options to pass to
          `blobxfer`.
* (optional) `remove_container_after_exit` property specifies if the
container should be automatically removed/cleaned up after it exits. This
defaults to `false`. This overrides the job-level property, if set. This
option only applies to Docker containers.
* (optional) `shm_size` property specifies the size of `/dev/shm` in
the container. The default is `64m`. The postfix unit can be designated
as `b` (bytes), `k` (kilobytes), `m` (megabytes), or `g` (gigabytes). This
value may need to be increased from the default of `64m` for certain
Docker applications, including multi-instance tasks using Intel MPI
(see [issue #8](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/issues/8)). This
overrides the job-level property, if set. This option only applies to
Docker containers.
* (optional) `additional_docker_run_options` is an array of addition Docker
run options that should be passed to the Docker daemon when starting this
container. The option only applies to Docker containers.
* (optional) `infiniband` designates if this container requires access to the
Infiniband/RDMA devices on the host. Note that this will automatically
force the container to use the host network stack. If this property is
set to `true`, ensure that the `pool_specification` property
`inter_node_communication_enabled` is set to `true`. This overrides the
job-level property, if set. It follows the same default behavior as the
job-level property if not set.
* (optional) `gpu` designates if this container requires access to the GPU
devices on the host. If this property is set to `true`, Docker containers
are instantiated via `nvidia-docker` and the appropriate options are passed
for Singularity containers. This requires N-series VM instances.
This overrides the job-level property, if set. It follows the same default
behavior as the job-level property if not set.
* (optional) `max_task_retries` sets the maximum number of times that
Azure Batch should retry this task for. This overrides the job-level task
retry count. By default, Azure Batch does not retry tasks that fail
(i.e. `max_task_retries` is 0). Note that `remove_container_after_exit`
must be `true` (the default) in order for retries to work properly.
* (optional) `max_wall_time` sets the maximum wallclock time for this task.
Please note that if this is greater than the job-level constraint, then
the job-level contraint takes precendence. By default, or if not set, this
is infinite, however, please note that tasks can only run for a maximum
of 7-days due to an Azure Batch limitation. The format for this property
is a timedelta with a string representation of "d.HH:mm:ss".
* (optional) `retention_time` sets the timedelta to retain the task
directory on the compute node where it ran after the task completes.
The format for this property is a timedelta with a string representation
of "d.HH:mm:ss". For example, "1.12:00:00" would allow the compute node
to clean up this task's directory 36 hours after the task completed. The
default, if unspecified, is 7 days. This overrides the job-level property.
* (optional) `exit_conditions` sets the exit conditions for this task.
Currently only the `default` exit conditions can be set which react to
any non-zero exit code. This and any nested property within `exit_conditions`
setting overrides the job-level property, if set.
    * (required) `default` is the default exit conditions. Meaning if this
      task exits with a non-zero exit code, perform the following actions
      below.
        * (optional) `job_action` is the job action to perform if this task
          exits with a non-zero exit code. This can be set to `none`,
          `disable`, or `terminate`. The default is `none`.
        * (optional) `dependency_action` is the dependency action to perform
          if this task exits with a non-zero exit code. This can be set to
          `block` or `satisfy`. The default is `block`.
* (optional) `multi_instance` is a property indicating that this task is a
multi-instance task. This is required if the task to run is an MPI
program. Additional information about multi-instance tasks and Batch
Shipyard can be found
[here](80-batch-shipyard-multi-instance-tasks.md). Do not define this
property for tasks that are not multi-instance. Additional members of this
property are:
    * `num_instances` is a property setting the number of compute node
      instances are required for this multi-instance task. Note that it is
      generally recommended not to use low priority nodes for multi-instance
      tasks as compute nodes may be pre-empted at any time. This property
      can be any one of the following:
        1. An integral number. Note that if there are insufficient nodes to
           matching this number, the task will be blocked.
        2. `pool_current_dedicated` which is the instantaneous reading of the
           target pool's current dedicated count during this function
           invocation.
        3. `pool_current_low_priority` which is the instantaneous reading of
           the target pool's current low priority count during this function
           invocation.
        4. `pool_specification_vm_count_dedicated` which is the
           `vm_count`:`dedicated` specified in the pool configuration.
        5. `pool_specification_vm_count_low_priority` which is the
           `vm_count`:`low_priority` specified in the pool configuration.
    * `coordination_command` is the coordination command this is run by each
      instance (compute node) of this multi-instance task prior to the
      application command. This command must not block and must exit
      successfully for the multi-instance task to proceed. For Docker
      containers, this is the command passed to the container in `docker run`
      for multi-instance tasks. This Docker container will automatically be
      daemonized for multi-instance tasks running on non-`native` pools. This
      is optional and may be null. For Singularity containers, usually
      this property will be unspecified.
    * `resource_files` is an array of resource files that should be downloaded
      as part of the multi-instance task. Each array entry contains the
      following information:
        * `file_path` is the path within the task working directory to place
          the file on the compute node.
        * `blob_source` is an accessible HTTP/HTTPS URL. This need not be an
          Azure Blob Storage URL.
        * `file_mode` if the file mode to set for the file on the compute node.
          This is optional.
* (optional) `entrypoint` is the property that can override the Docker image
defined `ENTRYPOINT`. This option only applies to Docker containers.
* (optional) `command` is the command to execute in the container
context. If this task is a regular non-multi-instance task, then this is
the command passed to the container context during `docker run` for
a Docker container or to the `singularity_cmd` for a Singularity container.
If this task is a multi-instance task under a Docker container, then this
`command` is the application command and is executed with `docker exec` in
the running Docker container context from the `coordination_command` in the
`multi_instance` property. If this task is a multi-instance task under a
Singularity container, then this `command` acts similar to a regular
non-multi-instance task as no special run+exec behavior is needed with
Singularity containers to achieve multi-instance execution. Thus, for
multi-instance tasks with Singularity containers, this command is the
actual command executed on the host without any modifications such as
with a regular task (i.e., prepending with `singularity exec`). When executing
a Singularity container under a multi-instance task, an additional
environment variable is populated, `SHIPYARD_SINGULARITY_COMMAND` which
can be used in custom scripts to control execution (note that this command
will need to be expanded prior to use as it may contain other environment
variables). This property may be null. Note that if you are using a
`task_factory` for the specification, then task factory arguments are
applied to the `command`. Therefore, Python-style string formatting
options (excluding keyword formatting) are required for certain task
factories that generate parameters to modify the `command`:
`{}` positional, `{0}` numbering style, or `{keyword}` keyword style
formatters are required depending upon the `task_factory` used. Please
see the [Task Factory Guide](35-batch-shipyard-task-factory-merge-task.md)
for more information.

`merge_task` is an optional property that defines a final task that should
be run after all tasks specified within the `tasks` array complete. All
properties that can be specified for a normal task can be specified for
a `merge_task` except for: `depends_on`, `depends_on_range`, `multi_instance`,
and `task_factory`. If no `id` is specified for the `merge_task` the task
id will be generated from the `autogenerated_task_id` settings with a task
id of `merge-task-NNNNN` (e.g., if the `prefix` is `task-` with a `padding` of
`5`, then the first merge task `id` will be `merge-task-00000`). Please
see the [Merge Task Guide](35-batch-shipyard-task-factory-merge-task.md)
for more information.
