# Batch Shipyard
<img src="https://azurebatchshipyard.blob.core.windows.net/github/README-dash.gif" alt="dashboard" width="1024" />

[Batch Shipyard](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard) is a tool to help
provision, execute, and monitor container-based batch processing and HPC
workloads on
[Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/batch/). Batch Shipyard
supports both [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io) containers. No experience with the
[Azure Batch SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-batch-samples) is needed; run
your containers with easy-to-understand configuration files. All Azure
regions are supported, including non-public Azure regions.

Additionally, Batch Shipyard provides the ability to provision and manage
entire [standalone remote file systems (storage clusters)](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/65-batch-shipyard-remote-fs/)
in Azure, independent of any integrated Azure Batch functionality.

## Major Features
### Container Runtime and Image Management
* Support for multiple container runtimes including
[Docker](https://docker.com), [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io), and
[Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/) tuned for Azure Batch
compute nodes
* Automated deployment of container images required for tasks to compute nodes
* Support for container registries including
[Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/)
for both Docker and Singularity images (ORAS), other Internet-accessible
public and private registries, and support for
the [Sylabs Singularity Library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) and
[Singularity Hub](https://singularity-hub.org/)
* Transparent support for GPU-accelerated container applications on both
[Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) and Singularity
on [Azure N-Series VM instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu)
* Transparent assist for running Docker and Singularity containers utilizing
Infiniband/RDMA on HPC Azure VM instances including
[A-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc),
[H-Series](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc),

support: move data easily between locally accessible storage systems, remote
filesystems, Azure Blob or File Storage, and compute nodes
* [Standalone Remote Filesystem Provisioning](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/65-batch-shipyard-remote-fs/)
with integration to auto-link these filesystems to compute nodes with
support for [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) and
[GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) distributed network file system
* Automatic shared data volume support for linking to
[Remote Filesystems](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/65-batch-shipyard-remote-fs/),
[Azure File](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/)
via SMB, [Azure Blob](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/)
via [blobfuse](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse),
[GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) provisioned directly on compute nodes,
and custom Linux mount support (fstab)
* Support for automated on-demand, per-job distributed scratch space
provisioning via [BeeGFS BeeOND](https://www.beegfs.io/wiki/BeeOND)

### Monitoring
* Automated, integrated
[resource monitoring](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/66-batch-shipyard-resource-monitoring/)
with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
for Batch pools and RemoteFS storage clusters
* Support for [Batch Insights](https://github.com/Azure/batch-insights)

### Open Source Scheduler Integration
* Support for [elastic cloud bursting](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/69-batch-shipyard-slurm/)
on [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) to Batch pools with automated
RemoteFS shared file system linking

### Azure Ecosystem Integration
* Support for
[serverless execution](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/60-batch-shipyard-site-extension/)
binding with Azure Functions
* Support for credential management through
[Azure KeyVault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/)

### Azure Batch Integration and Enhancements
* [Federation](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/68-batch-shipyard-federation/)
support: enables unified, constraint-based scheduling to collections of
heterogeneous pools, including across multiple Batch accounts and Azure
regions
* Support for simple, scenario-based [pool autoscale](https://batch-shipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/30-batch-shipyard-autoscale/)
