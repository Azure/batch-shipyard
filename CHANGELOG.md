# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Sample Windows container recipes
- Added environment variables to pool configuration, which allows users to
setup Batch environment variables for the start task.

### Fixed
- Some commands were incorrectly failing due to nodeid conflicts with
supplied parameters

## [3.6.1] - 2018-12-03
### Added
- `force_enable_task_dependencies` property in jobs configuration to turn
on task dependencies on a job even when no task dependencies are present
initially. This is useful when tasks are added at a later time that may
have dependencies. Please consult the jobs documentation for more information.
- Windows Server 2019 support
- Genomics and Bioinformatics recipes: BLAST and RNASeq
- PyTorch recipes

### Changed
- Updated Docker CE to 18.09.0
- Updated blobxfer to 1.5.5
- Updated NC/ND driver to 410.79
- Updated NV driver to 410.71 with CUDA10 support
- Updated other dependencies to latest

### Fixed
- `--tail` console output occasionally repeating characters
- NV provisioning regressions
- Windows node prep issue
- fs cluster status issue
- Retry MSI provisioning for discrete VM resources

## [3.6.0] - 2018-11-06 (SC18 Edition)
### Added
- Kata containers support: run containers on Linux compute nodes with a higher
level of isolation through lightweight VMs. Please see the pool doc for more
information.
- Per-job distributed scratch space support: create on-demand scratch
space shared between tasks of a job which can be particularly useful for MPI
and multi-instance tasks without having to manage a GlusterFS-on-compute
shared data volume. Please see both the pool doc and jobs doc for more
information.
- Add `restrict_default_bind_mounts` option to jobs specifications. This
will restrict automatic host directory bindings to the container filesystem
only to `$AZ_BATCH_TASK_DIR`. This is particularly useful in combination with
container runtimes enforcing VM-level isolation such as Kata containers.
- Allow installation and selection of multiple container runtimes along with
a default container runtime for Docker invocations. Please see the pool doc
for more information under `container_runtimes`.
- Support for Standard SSD and Ultra SSD managed disks for RemoteFS clusters.
In conjunction with this change, Availability Zone support has been added
for manage disks and storage cluster VMs. Please see the relevant
documentation for more information.

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** the `premium` property under `remote_fs`:`managed_disks`
has been replaced with `sku`. Please see the RemoteFS configuration doc for
more information.
- **Breaking Change:** the Singularity container runtime is no longer installed
by default, please see the pool doc to configure pools to install Singularity
as needed under `container_runtimes`:`install`.

and `aad` with the `batch` section of the credentials config. The prior
behavior was that `account_key` would take precedence over `aad`. Now
these options are mutually exclusive. This will now break configurations
that specified `aad` at the global level while having a shared `account_key`
at the `batch` level. ([#197](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/issues/197))

      (requires an SSH user)
    - `pool nodes zap` will kill (and optionally remove) **all** running
      Docker containers on nodes in a pool (requires an SSH user). Note that
      `jobs tasks term` is the preferred command to control individual
      (or grouped) task termination or `jobs term --termtasks` to terminate
      at the job level.
    - `storage sas create` command added as a utility helper function to
      create SAS tokens for given storage accounts in credentials

Service Batch accounts (#126)
- Support for deploying custom image compute nodes from an ARM Image resource
(#126)
- Support for multiple public and private container registries (#127)
- YAML configuration support. JSON formatted configuration files will continue
to be supported, however, note the breaking change with the corresponding
environment variable names for specifying individual config files from the
commandline. (#122)
- Option to automatically attempt recovery of unusable nodes during
pool allocation or resize. See the `attempt_recovery_on_unusable` option in
the pool configuration doc.
- Virtual Network guide

`alfpark/batch-shipyard:<version>-cli` where `<version>` is the release
version or `latest` for whatever is in `master`. (#130)
- **Breaking Change:** Fully qualified Docker image names are now required
under both the global config `global_resources`.`docker_images` and jobs
`task` array `docker_image` (or `image`). The `docker_registry` property
in the global config file is no longer valid. (#106)
- **Breaking Change:** Docker private registries backed to Azure Storage blobs
are no longer supported. This is not to be confused with the Classic Azure
Container Registries which are still supported. (#44)
- **Breaking Change:** `docker_registry` property in the global config is
no longer required. An `additional_registries` option is available for any
additional registries that are not present from the `docker_images`
array in `global_resources` but require a valid login. (#106)
- **Breaking Change:** Data ingress/egress from/to Azure Storage along with
`task_factory`:`file` has changed to accommodate `blobxfer 1.0.0` commandline
and options. There are new expanded options available, including multiple
`include` and `exclude` along with `remote_path` explicit specifications
(instead of general `container` or `file_share`). Please see the appropriate
global config, pool or job configuration docs for more information. (#47)
- **Breaking Change:** `image_uris` in the `vm_configuration`:`custom_image`
property of the pool configuration has been replaced with `arm_image_id`
which is a reference to an ARM Image resource. Please see the custom image
guide for more information. (#126)
- **Breaking Change:** environment variables `SHIPYARD_CREDENTIALS_JSON`,
`SHIPYARD_CONFIG_JSON`, `SHIPYARD_POOL_JSON`, `SHIPYARD_JOBS_JSON`, and
`SHIPYARD_FS_JSON` have been renamed to `SHIPYARD_CREDENTIALS_CONF`,
`SHIPYARD_CONFIG_CONF`, `SHIPYARD_POOL_CONF`, `SHIPYARD_JOBS_CONF`, and
`SHIPYARD_FS_CONF` respectively. (#122)
- `--configdir` or `SHIPYARD_CONFIGDIR` now defaults to the current working
directory (i.e., `.`) if no other conf file options are specified.
- `aad` can be specified at a "global" level in the credentials configuration
file, which is then applied to `batch`, `keyvault` and/or `management`
section. Please see the credentials configuration guide for more information.
- `docker_image` is now preferred over the deprecated `image` property in
the `task` array in the jobs configuration file
- `gpu` and `infiniband` under the jobs configuration are now optional. GPU
and/or RDMA capable compute nodes will be autodetected and the proper
devices and other settings will be automatically be applied to tasks running
on these compute nodes. You can force disable GPU and/or RDMA by setting
`gpu` and `infiniband` properties to `false`. (#124)

all nodes and provide warning for mismatched images amongst compute nodes.
This functionality requires a provisioned SSH user and private key.
- `max_wall_time` option for both jobs and tasks. Please consult the
documentation for the difference when specifying this option at either the
job or task level.
- `--poll-until-tasks-complete` option for `jobs listtasks` to block the CLI
from exiting until all tasks under jobs for which the command is run have
completed
- `--tty` option for `pool ssh` and `fs cluster ssh` to enable allocation
of a pseudo-tty for the SSH session

### Changed
- `remove_container_after_exit`, `retention_time`, `shm_size`, `infiniband`,
`gpu` can now be specified at the job-level and overriden at the task-level
in the jobs configuration

- Support for [Low Priority Batch Compute Nodes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-low-pri-vms)
- `resize_timeout` can now be specified on the pool specification
- `--clear-tables` option to `storage del` command which will delete
blob containers and queues but clear table entries
- `--ssh` option to `pool udi` command which will force the update Docker
images command to update over SSH instead of through a Batch job. This is
useful if you want to perform an out-of-band update of Docker image(s), e.g.,
your pool is currently busy processing tasks and would not be able to
accommodate another task.

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** `vm_count` in the pool specification is now a
complex property consisting of the properties `dedicated` and `low_priority`
- Updated all dependencies to latest

### Fixed
- Improve node startup time for GPU NC-series by removing extraneous
dependencies
- `fs cluster ssh` storage cluster id and command argument ordering was
inverted. This has been corrected to be as intended where the command
is the last argument, e.g., `fs cluster ssh mynfs -- df -h`

## [2.6.2] - 2017-05-05

- TensorFlow image not being set if no suitable image is found for
`misc tensorboard` command
- Authentication for running images not present in global config sourced
from a private registry

## [2.6.1] - 2017-05-01
### Added
- `misc tensorboard` command added which automatically instantiates a
Tensorboard instance on the compute node which is running or has ran a
task that has generated TensorFlow summary operation compatible logs. An
SSH tunnel is then created so you can view Tensorboard locally on the
machine running Batch Shipyard. This requires a valid SSH user that has been
provisioned via Batch Shipyard with private keys available. This command
will work on Windows if `ssh.exe` is available in `%PATH%` or the current
working directory. Please see the usage guide for more information about
this command.
- Pool-level `resource_files` support

### Changed
- Added optional `COMMAND` argument to `pool ssh` and `fs cluster ssh`
commands. If `COMMAND` is specified, the command is run non-interactively
with SSH on the target node.
- Added some additional sanity checks in the node prep script
- Updated TensorFlow-CPU and TensorFlow-GPU recipes to 1.1.0. Removed
specialized Docker build for TensorFlow-GPU. Added `jobs-tb.json` files
to TensorFlow-CPU and TensorFlow-GPU recipes as Tensorboard samples.
- Optimize some Batch calls

### Fixed
- Site extension issues
- SSH user add exception on Windows
- `jobs del --termtasks` will now disable the job prior to running task
termination to prevent active tasks in job from running while tasks are
being terminated
- `jobs listtasks` and `data listfiles` will now accept a `--jobid` that
does not have to be in `jobs.json`
- Data ingress on pool create issue with single node

## [2.6.0] - 2017-04-20
### Changed
- Update to latest dependencies

### Fixed
- Checks that prevented ssh/scp/openssl interaction on Windows
- SSH private key regression in data ingress direct to compute node

## [2.6.0rc1] - 2017-04-14
### Added
- Richer SSH options with new `ssh_public_key_data` and `ssh_private_key`
properties in `ssh` configuration blocks (for both `pool.json` and
`fs.json`).
  - `ssh_public_key_data` allows direct embedding of SSH public keys in
    OpenSSH format into the config files.
  - `ssh_private_key` specifies where the private key is located with
    respect to pre-created public keys (either `ssh_public_key` or
    `ssh_public_key_data`). This allows transparent `pool ssh` or
    `fs cluster ssh` commands with pre-created keys.
- RemoteFS-GlusterFS+BatchPool recipe

### Changed
- Docker installations are now pinned to a specific Docker version which
should reduce sudden breaking changes introduced upstream by Docker and/or
the distribution
- Fault domains for multi-vm storage clusters are now set to 2 by default but
can be configured using the `fault_domains` property. This was lowered from
the prior default of 3 due to managed disks and availability set restrictions
as some regions do not support 3 fault domains with this combination.
- Updated NC-series Tesla driver to 375.51

### Fixed
- Broken Docker installations due to gpgkey changes
- Possible race condition between disk setup and glusterfs volume create
- Forbid SSH username to be the same as the samba username
- Allow smbd.service to auto-restart with delay

## [2.6.0b3] - 2017-04-03
### Added
- Created [Azure App Service Site Extension](https://www.siteextensions.net/packages/batch-shipyard).
You can now one-click install Batch Shipyard as a site extension (after you
have Python installed) and use Batch Shipyard from an Azure Function trigger.
- Samba support on storage cluster servers
- Add sample RemoteFS recipes for NFS and GlusterFS
- `install.cmd` installer for Windows. `install_conda_windows.cmd` has been
replaced by `install.cmd`, please see the install doc for more information.

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** `multi_instance_auto_complete` under
`job_specifications` is now named `auto_complete`. This property will apply
to all types of jobs and not just multi-instance tasks. The default is now
`false` (instead of `true` for the old `multi_instance_auto_complete`).
- **Breaking Change:** `static_public_ip` has been replaced with a `public_ip`
complex property. This is to accommodate for situations where public IP for
RemoteFS is disabled. Please see the Remote FS configuration doc for more
info.
- `install.sh` now handles Anaconda Python environments
- `--cardinal 0` is now implicit if no `--hostname` or `--nodeid` is specified
for `fs cluster ssh` or `pool ssh` commands, respectively
- Allow `docker_images` in `global_resources` to be empty. Note that it is
always recommended to pre-load images on to pools for consistent scheduling
latencies from pool idle.

### Fixed
- Removed requirement of a `batch` credential section for pure `fs` operations
- Multi-instance auto complete setting not being properly read
- `install.sh` virtual environment issues

- `allow_run_on_missing_image` option to jobs that allows tasks to execute
under jobs with Docker images that have not been pre-loaded via the
`global_resources`:`docker_images` setting in config.json. Note that, if
possible, you should attempt to specify all Docker images that you intend
to run in the `global_resources`:`docker_images` property in the global
configuration to minimize scheduling to task execution latency.
- Support for running containers as a different user identity (uid/gid)
- Support for Canonical/UbuntuServer/16.04-LTS. 16.04-LTS should be used over
the old 16.04.0-LTS sku due to
[issue #31](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/issues/31) and is no
longer receiving updates.

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** `glusterfs` `volume_driver` for `shared_data_volumes`
should now be named as `glusterfs_on_compute`. This is to distinguish between
co-located GlusterFS on compute nodes with standalone GlusterFS
`storage_cluster` remote mounted distributed file system.
- Logging now has less verbose details (call origin) by default. Prior
behavior can be restored with the `-v` option.
- Pool existance is now checked prior to job submission and can now proceed
to add without an active pool.
- Batch `account` (name) is now an optional property in the credentials config
- Configuration doc broken up into multiple pages
- Update all recipes using Canonical/UbuntuServer/16.04.0-LTS to use
Canonical/UbuntuServer/16.04-LTS instead
- Configuration is no longer shown with `-v`. Use `--show-config` to dump
the complete configuration being used for the command.
- Precompile Python files during build for Docker images
- All dependencies updated to latest versions
- Update Batch API call compatibility for `azure-batch 2.0.0`

### Fixed
- Logging time format and incorrect Zulu time designation.
- `scp` and `multinode_scp` data movement capability is now supported in
Windows given `ssh.exe` and `scp.exe` can be found in `%PATH%` or the current
working directory. `rsync` methods are not supported on Windows.
- Credential encryption is now supported in Windows given `openssl.exe` can
be found in `%PATH%` or the current working directory.

## [2.5.4] - 2017-03-08
### Changed
- Downloaded files are now verified via SHA256 instead of MD5
- Updated NC-series Tesla driver to 375.39

### Fixed
- `nvidia-docker` updated to 1.0.1 for compatibility with Docker CE

## [2.5.3] - 2017-03-01
### Added
- `pool rebootnode` command added which allows single node reboot control.
Additionally, the option `--all-start-task-failed` will reboot all nodes in
the specified pool with the start task failed state.
- `jobs del` and `jobs term` now provide a `--termtasks` option to
allow the logic of `jobs termtasks` to precede the delete or terminate
action to the job. This option requires a valid SSH user to the remote nodes
as specified in the `ssh` configuration property in `pool.json`. This new
option is normally not needed if all tasks within the jobs have completed.

### Changed
- The Docker image used for blobxfer is now tied to the specific Batch
Shipyard release
- Default SSH user expiry time if not specified is now 30 days
- All recipes now have the default config.json storage account set to the
link as named in the provided credentials.json file. Now, only the credentials
file needs to be modified to run a recipe.

## [2.5.2] - 2017-02-23
### Added
- Chainer-CPU and Chainer-GPU recipes
- [Troubleshooting guide](docs/96-troubleshooting-guide.md)

with the `depends_on_range` property under each task json property in `tasks`
in the jobs configuration file. Please see the configuration doc for more
information.
- Support for `environment_variables_secret_id` in job and task definitions.
Specifying these properties will fetch manually added secrets (in the form of

for more information.
- Added subcommand `listskus` to the `pool` command to list available
VM configurations (publisher, offer, sku) for the Batch account

### Changed
- Nodeprep now references cascade and tfm docker images by version instead
of latest to prevent breaking changes affecting older versions. Docker builds
of cascade and tfm based on latest commits are now disabled.

### Fixed
- Cascade docker image run not propagating exit code

## [2.0.0] - 2016-11-23
### Added
- Support for any Internet accessible container registry, including
[Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/).
Please see the configuration doc for information on how to integrate with
a private container registry.

### Changed
- GPU driver for `STANDARD_NC` instances defined in the
`gpu`:`nvidia_driver`:`source` property is no longer required. If omitted,
an NVIDIA driver will be downloaded automatically with an NVIDIA License
agreement prompt. For `STANDARD_NV` instances, a driver URL is still required.

node destinations. This allows arbitrary specification of where ingressed
files should be placed relative to the destination path.
- Added ability to ingress directly into the host without the requirement
of GlusterFS for pools with one compute node. A GlusterFS shared volume is
required for pools with more than one compute node for direct to pool data
ingress.
- New commands and options:
  - `pool udi`: Update docker images on all compute nodes in a pool. `--image`
    and `--digest` options can restrict the scope of the update.
  - `data stream`: `--disk` will stream the file as binary to disk instead
    of as text to the local console
  - `data listfiles`: `--jobid` and `--taskid` allows scoping of the list
    files action
  - `jobs listtasks`: `--jobid` allows scoping of list tasks to a specific job
  - `jobs add`: `--tail` allows tailing the specified file for the last job
    and task added
- Keras+Theano-CPU and Keras+Theano-GPU recipes
- Keras+Theano-CPU added as an option in the quickstart guide

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** Properties of `docker_registry` have changed
significantly to support eventual integration with the Azure Container
Registry service. Credentials for docker logins have moved to the credentials
json file. Please see the configuration doc for more information.
- `files` data ingress no longer creates a directory where files to
be uploaded exist. For example if uploading from a path `/a/b/c`, the
directory `c` is no longer created at the destination. Instead all files
found in `/a/b/c` will be immediately placed directly at the destination
path with sub-directories preserved. This behavior can be modified with
the `relative_destination_path` property.
- `CUDA_CACHE_*` variables are now set for GPU jobs such that compiled targets
pass-through to the host. This allows subsequent container invocations within
the same node the ability to reuse cached PTX JIT targets.
- `batch_shipyard`:`storage_entity_prefix` is now optional and defaults to
`shipyard` if not specified.
- Major internal configuration/settings refactor

### Fixed
- Pool resize down with wait
- More Python2/3 compatibility issues
- Ensure pools that deploy GlusterFS volumes have more than 1 node

## [2.0.0rc2] - 2016-11-02
### Added
- `install.sh` install/setup helper script
- `shipyard` execution helper script created via `install.sh`
- `generated_sas_expiry_days` json property to config json for the ability to
override the default number of days generated SAS keys are valid for.
- New options on commands/subcommands:
  - `jobs add`: `--recreate` recreate any jobs which have completed and use
    the same id
  - `jobs termtasks`: `--force` force docker kill to tasks even if they are
    in completed state
  - `pool resize`: `--wait` wait for completion of resize
- HPCG-Infiniband-IntelMPI and HPLinpack-Infiniband-IntelMPI recipes

### Changed
- Default SAS expiry time used for resource files and data movement changed
from 7 to 30 days.
- Pools failing to start will now automatically retrieve stdout.txt and
stderr.txt to the current working directory under
`poolid/<node ids>/std{out,err}.txt`. These files can be inspected
locally and submitted as context for GitHub issues if pertinent.
- Pool resizing will now attempt to add an SSH user on the new nodes if
an SSH public key is referenced or found in the invocation directory
- Improve installation doc

### Fixed
- Improve Python2/3 compatibility
- Unicode literals warning with Click
- Config file loading issue in some contexts
- Documentation typos

    Batch Task with `input_data` in pool and jobs configuration
    - Pool-level: to compute nodes
    - Job-level: to compute nodes prior to running the specified job
    - Task-level: to compute nodes prior to running a task of a job
  - Egress to local machine as actions
    - Single file from compute node
    - Entire task-level directories from compute node
    - Entire node-level directories from compute node
  - Egress to Azure Blob of File Storage with `output_data` in jobs
    configuration

- Configurable path to place files generated by `pool add` or `pool asu`
commands
- MXNet-CPU and Torch-CPU as options in the quickstart guide
- Update CNTK recipes for 1.7.2 and switch multinode/multigpu samples to
MNIST
- MXNet-CPU and MXNet-GPU recipes

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** All new CLI experience with proper multilevel commands.
Please see usage doc for more information.
  - Added new commands: `cert`, `data`
  - Added many new convenience subcommands
  - `--filespec` is now delimited by `,` instead of `:`
- **Breaking Change:** `ssh_docker_tunnel` in the `pool_specification` has
been replaced by the `ssh` property. `generate_tunnel_script` has been renamed
to `generate_docker_tunnel_script`. Please see the configuration doc for
more information.
- The `name` property of a task json object in the jobs specification is no
longer required for multi-instance tasks. If not specified, `name` defaults
to `id` for all task types.
- `data stream` no longer has an arbitrary max streaming time; the action will
stream the file indefinitely until the task completes
- Validate container with `storage_entity_prefix` for length issues
- `pool del` action now cleans up and deletes some storage containers
immediately afterwards (with confirmation prompts)
- `/opt/intel` is no longer automatically mounted for infiniband-enabled
containers on SUSE SLES-HPC hosts. Please see the configuration doc
on how to manually map this directory if required. OpenLogic CentOS-HPC
hosts remain unchanged.
- Modularized code base

### Fixed
