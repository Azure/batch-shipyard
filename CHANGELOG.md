# Change Log

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Possible race condition between disk setup and glusterfs volume create

## [2.6.0b3] - 2017-04-03
### Added
- Created [Azure App Service Site Extension](https://www.siteextensions.net/packages/batch-shipyard).
You can now one-click install Batch Shipyard as a site extension (after you
have Python installed) and use Batch Shipyard from an Azure Function trigger.
- Samba support on storage cluster servers
- Add sample RemoteFS recipes for NFS and GlusterFS
- `install.cmd` installer for Windows. `install_conda_windows.cmd` has been
replaced by `install.cmd`, please see the install doc for more information.

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** `multi_instance_auto_complete` under
`job_specifications` is now named `auto_complete`. This property will apply
to all types of jobs and not just multi-instance tasks. The default is now
`false` (instead of `true` for the old `multi_instance_auto_complete`).
- **Breaking Change:** `static_public_ip` has been replaced with a `public_ip`
complex property. This is to accommodate for situations where public IP for
RemoteFS is disabled. Please see the Remote FS configuration doc for more
info.
- `install.sh` now handles Anaconda Python environments
- `--cardinal 0` is now implicit if no `--hostname` or `--nodeid` is specified
for `fs cluster ssh` or `pool ssh` commands, respectively
- Allow `docker_images` in `global_resources` to be empty. Note that it is
always recommended to pre-load images on to pools for consistent scheduling
latencies from pool idle.

### Fixed
- Removed requirement of a `batch` credential section for pure `fs` operations
- Multi-instance auto complete setting not being properly read
- `install.sh` virtual environment issues
- Fix pool ingress data calls with remotefs (#62)
- Move additional node prep commands to last set of commands to execute in
start task (#63)
- `glusterfs_on_compute` shared data volume issues
- future and pathlib compat issues
- Python2 unicode/str issues with management libraries

## [2.6.0b2] - 2017-03-22
### Added
- Added virtual environment install option for `install.sh` which is now
the recommended way to install Batch Shipyard. Please see the install
guide for more information. (#55)

### Changed
- Force SSD optimizations for btrfs with premium storage

### Fixed
- Incorrect FS server options parsing at script time
- KeyVault client not initialized in `fs` contexts (#57)
- Check pool current node count prior to executing `pool udi` task (#58)
- Initialization with KeyVault uri on commandline (#59)

## [2.6.0b1] - 2017-03-16
### Added
- Support for provisioning storage clusters via the `fs cluster` command
  - Support for NFS (single VM, scale up)
  - Support for GlusterFS (multi VM, scale up and out)
- Support for provisioning managed disks via the `fs disks` command
- Support for data ingress to provisioned storage clusters
- Support for
[UserSubscription Batch accounts](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowshpc/2017/03/17/azure-batch-vnet-and-custom-image-support-for-virtual-machine-pools/)
- Azure Active Directory authentication support for Batch accounts
- Support for specifying a virtual network to use with a compute pool
- `allow_run_on_missing_image` option to jobs that allows tasks to execute
under jobs with Docker images that have not been pre-loaded via the
`global_resources`:`docker_images` setting in config.json. Note that, if
possible, you should attempt to specify all Docker images that you intend
to run in the `global_resources`:`docker_images` property in the global
configuration to minimize scheduling to task execution latency.
- Support for running containers as a different user identity (uid/gid)
- Support for Canonical/UbuntuServer/16.04-LTS. 16.04-LTS should be used over
the old 16.04.0-LTS sku due to
[issue #31](https://github.com/Azure/batch-shipyard/issues/31) and is no
longer receiving updates.

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** `glusterfs` `volume_driver` for `shared_data_volumes`
should now be named as `glusterfs_on_compute`. This is to distinguish between
co-located GlusterFS on compute nodes with standalone GlusterFS
`storage_cluster` remote mounted distributed file system.
- Logging now has less verbose details (call origin) by default. Prior
behavior can be restored with the `-v` option.
- Pool existance is now checked prior to job submission and can now proceed
to add without an active pool.
- Batch `account` (name) is now an optional property in the credentials config
- Configuration doc broken up into multiple pages
- Update all recipes using Canonical/UbuntuServer/16.04.0-LTS to use
Canonical/UbuntuServer/16.04-LTS instead
- Configuration is no longer shown with `-v`. Use `--show-config` to dump
the complete configuration being used for the command.
- Precompile Python files during build for Docker images
- All dependencies updated to latest versions
- Update Batch API call compatibility for `azure-batch 2.0.0`

### Fixed
- Logging time format and incorrect Zulu time designation.
- `scp` and `multinode_scp` data movement capability is now supported in
Windows given `ssh.exe` and `scp.exe` can be found in `%PATH%` or the current
working directory. `rsync` methods are not supported on Windows.
- Credential encryption is now supported in Windows given `openssl.exe` can
be found in `%PATH%` or the current working directory.

## [2.5.4] - 2017-03-08
### Changed
- Downloaded files are now verified via SHA256 instead of MD5
- Updated NC-series Tesla driver to 375.39

### Fixed
- `nvidia-docker` updated to 1.0.1 for compatibility with Docker CE

## [2.5.3] - 2017-03-01
### Added
- `pool rebootnode` command added which allows single node reboot control.
Additionally, the option `--all-start-task-failed` will reboot all nodes in
the specified pool with the start task failed state.
- `jobs del` and `jobs term` now provide a `--termtasks` option to
allow the logic of `jobs termtasks` to precede the delete or terminate
action to the job. This option requires a valid SSH user to the remote nodes
as specified in the `ssh` configuration property in `pool.json`. This new
option is normally not needed if all tasks within the jobs have completed.

### Changed
- The Docker image used for blobxfer is now tied to the specific Batch
Shipyard release
- Default SSH user expiry time if not specified is now 30 days
- All recipes now have the default config.json storage account set to the
link as named in the provided credentials.json file. Now, only the credentials
file needs to be modified to run a recipe.

## [2.5.2] - 2017-02-23
### Added
- Chainer-CPU and Chainer-GPU recipes
- [Troubleshooting guide](docs/96-troubleshooting-guide.md)

### Changed
- Perform automatic container path substitution with host path for
GlusterFS data ingress/egress from/to Azure Storage (#37)

### Fixed
- CNTK-GPU-OpenMPI run script fixed to allow multinode+singlegpu executions
- TensorFlow recipes updated for 1.0.0 release
- blobxfer data ingress on Windows (#39)
- Minor delete job and terminate tasks fixes

## [2.5.1] - 2017-02-01
### Added

information.
- Support for task data retention time (#30). See configuration doc for
more information.

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** `environment_variables_secret_id` was erroneously
named and has been renamed to `environment_variables_keyvault_secret_id` to
follow the other properties with similar behavior.
- Include Python 3.6 Travis CI target

### Fixed
- Automatically assigned task ids are now in the format `dockertask-NNNNN`
and will increment properly past 99999 but will not be padded after that (#27)
- Defect in list tasks for tasks that have not run (#28)
- Docker temporary directory not being set properly
- SLES-HPC will now install all Intel MPI related rpms
- Defect in task file mover for unencrypted credentials (#29)

## [2.5.0] - 2017-01-19
### Added
- Support for
[Task Dependency Id Ranges](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-task-dependencies#task-id-range)
with the `depends_on_range` property under each task json property in `tasks`
in the jobs configuration file. Please see the configuration doc for more
information.
- Support for `environment_variables_secret_id` in job and task definitions.
Specifying these properties will fetch manually added secrets (in the form of
a string representation of a json key-value dictionary) from the specified
KeyVault using AAD credentials. Please see the configuration doc for more
information.

### Fixed
- Remove extraneous import (#12)
- Defect in handling per key secret ids (#13)

options to be specified as environment variables. Please see the usage doc
for more information.
- Added subcommand `listskus` to the `pool` command to list available
VM configurations (publisher, offer, sku) for the Batch account

### Changed
- Nodeprep now references cascade and tfm docker images by version instead
of latest to prevent breaking changes affecting older versions. Docker builds
of cascade and tfm based on latest commits are now disabled.

### Fixed
- Cascade docker image run not propagating exit code

## [2.0.0] - 2016-11-23
### Added
- Support for any Internet accessible container registry, including
[Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/).
Please see the configuration doc for information on how to integrate with
a private container registry.

### Changed
- GPU driver for `STANDARD_NC` instances defined in the
`gpu`:`nvidia_driver`:`source` property is no longer required. If omitted,
an NVIDIA driver will be downloaded automatically with an NVIDIA License
agreement prompt. For `STANDARD_NV` instances, a driver URL is still required.
- Docker container name auto-tagging now prepends the job id in order to
prevent conflicts in case of un-named simultaneous tasks from multiple jobs
- Update CNTK docker images to 2.0beta4 and optimize GPU images for use
with NVIDIA K80/M60

- Some improvements with node prep and reboots
- Task termination will only issue `docker rm` if the container exists

## [2.0.0rc3] - 2016-11-14 (SC16 Edition)
### Added
- `install_conda_windows.cmd` helper script for installing Batch Shipyard
under Anaconda for Windows
- Added `relative_destination_path` json property for `files` ingress into
node destinations. This allows arbitrary specification of where ingressed
files should be placed relative to the destination path.
- Added ability to ingress directly into the host without the requirement
of GlusterFS for pools with one compute node. A GlusterFS shared volume is
required for pools with more than one compute node for direct to pool data
ingress.
- New commands and options:
  - `pool udi`: Update docker images on all compute nodes in a pool. `--image`
    and `--digest` options can restrict the scope of the update.
  - `data stream`: `--disk` will stream the file as binary to disk instead
    of as text to the local console
  - `data listfiles`: `--jobid` and `--taskid` allows scoping of the list
    files action
  - `jobs listtasks`: `--jobid` allows scoping of list tasks to a specific job
  - `jobs add`: `--tail` allows tailing the specified file for the last job
    and task added
- Keras+Theano-CPU and Keras+Theano-GPU recipes
- Keras+Theano-CPU added as an option in the quickstart guide

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** Properties of `docker_registry` have changed
significantly to support eventual integration with the Azure Container
Registry service. Credentials for docker logins have moved to the credentials
json file. Please see the configuration doc for more information.
- `files` data ingress no longer creates a directory where files to
be uploaded exist. For example if uploading from a path `/a/b/c`, the
directory `c` is no longer created at the destination. Instead all files
found in `/a/b/c` will be immediately placed directly at the destination
path with sub-directories preserved. This behavior can be modified with
the `relative_destination_path` property.
- `CUDA_CACHE_*` variables are now set for GPU jobs such that compiled targets
pass-through to the host. This allows subsequent container invocations within
the same node the ability to reuse cached PTX JIT targets.
- `batch_shipyard`:`storage_entity_prefix` is now optional and defaults to
`shipyard` if not specified.
- Major internal configuration/settings refactor

### Fixed
- Pool resize down with wait
- More Python2/3 compatibility issues
- Ensure pools that deploy GlusterFS volumes have more than 1 node

## [2.0.0rc2] - 2016-11-02
### Added
- `install.sh` install/setup helper script
- `shipyard` execution helper script created via `install.sh`
- `generated_sas_expiry_days` json property to config json for the ability to
override the default number of days generated SAS keys are valid for.
- New options on commands/subcommands:
  - `jobs add`: `--recreate` recreate any jobs which have completed and use
    the same id
  - `jobs termtasks`: `--force` force docker kill to tasks even if they are
    in completed state
  - `pool resize`: `--wait` wait for completion of resize
- HPCG-Infiniband-IntelMPI and HPLinpack-Infiniband-IntelMPI recipes

### Changed
- Default SAS expiry time used for resource files and data movement changed
from 7 to 30 days.
- Pools failing to start will now automatically retrieve stdout.txt and
stderr.txt to the current working directory under
`poolid/<node ids>/std{out,err}.txt`. These files can be inspected
locally and submitted as context for GitHub issues if pertinent.
- Pool resizing will now attempt to add an SSH user on the new nodes if
an SSH public key is referenced or found in the invocation directory
- Improve installation doc

### Fixed
- Improve Python2/3 compatibility
- Unicode literals warning with Click
- Config file loading issue in some contexts
- Documentation typos

## [2.0.0rc1] - 2016-10-28

to `generate_docker_tunnel_script`. Please see the configuration doc for
more information.
- The `name` property of a task json object in the jobs specification is no
longer required for multi-instance tasks. If not specified, `name` defaults
to `id` for all task types.
